<p>Eight dads were kind enough to complete the survey. Given the short and unscientific nature of the questions and the small sample size, this is not to be taken as gospel (or investment advice), but I think there is some good information in here, and even Gallup had to start somewhere right? <br>Let&#8217;s dig in.</p>



<h3>Simple Graphs, Question by Question</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-230" width="598" height="359" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image.png 797w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-300x180.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-768x461.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-676x405.png 676w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" /><figcaption> Five dads think the economy will get better, three dads disagree. </figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-231" width="585" height="441" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-1.png 780w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-1-300x226.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-1-768x579.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-1-676x510.png 676w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /><figcaption> Half of the dads have a &#8220;high&#8221; appetite for risk, with the other half split evenly between &#8220;low&#8221; and &#8220;moderate&#8221; appetite. </figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-232" width="525" height="444" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-2.png 700w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-2-300x254.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-2-676x572.png 676w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /><figcaption>A very similar split between Appetite for Risk, and Investment History Satisfaction</figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-3-1024x577.png" alt="" class="wp-image-233" width="600" height="360"/><figcaption>And again, the five-to-three dad split.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Well, that all makes sense, doesn&#8217;t it? You could easily draw the correlations between the questions and come to the conclusion that risk-taking dads are very satisfied with their investments, or that optimist dads won&#8217;t be changing strategy. But I wouldn&#8217;t set you up like that unless it was to tell you that you&#8217;re wrong.<br>Let&#8217;s put away these graphs and look at the numbers.</p>



<h3>The Numbers</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-234" width="725" height="159" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-4.png 967w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-4-300x66.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-4-768x168.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-4-676x148.png 676w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></figure>



<p>Despite the similar distributions, risk-taking dads are moderately  satisfied with their performance, while the low-risk dads are both very  satisfied.<br>I like that answers are more varied with the higher-risk dads.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-5-1024x312.png" alt="" class="wp-image-235" width="768" height="234" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-5-1024x312.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-5-300x91.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-5-768x234.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-5-676x206.png 676w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-5.png 1042w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>Here is where I start chalking things up to Dad-wisdom. Clearly, being &#8220;very satisfied&#8221; with your investment history doesn&#8217;t prescribe any course of action or economic outlook.<br>The &#8220;moderately satisfied&#8221; dads again agree that the economy will get better, and that their current strategy is the right one. Given that we&#8217;ve had the longest economic expansion in U.S. history (over a decade, and still going), they&#8217;ve had time to dial in the plan for growth.<br>The &#8220;not satisfied&#8221; dads are interesting, but it makes sense that they will either be changing their strategy, or battening down the hatches.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-7-1024x288.png" alt="" class="wp-image-237" width="768" height="216" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-7-1024x288.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-7-300x84.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-7-768x216.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-7-676x190.png 676w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image-7.png 1137w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>And another view, but with Investment Satisfaction replaced by Appetite for Risk. I suspect that many investors (myself included) tend to be bad at self-evaluating how risky we&#8217;re being. I&#8217;d say I have a medium appetite for risk, given that I&#8217;m relatively young and even bother having any bonds in my portfolio. But we&#8217;re not here to talk about me. Let&#8217;s get to the real good part.</p>



<h3>The Dad Wisdom</h3>



<p>Before I share the Dad Wisdom that was shared with me, I just need to put it out there that I had to quantify some qualitative data for this survey, so the data and therefore little analysis that I did is not the full picture of the dads.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the advice that the dads shared, in no particular order:</p>



<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>B</strong>uy stocks from companies with a history of dividend growth. Dividend income will remain constant should the market dip and reinvestment value of dividend income will increase proportionately with the severity of the drop in market price.</p>



<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>P</strong>ay off your debts. </p>



<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>M</strong>oney you don&#8217;t invest is money unearned.</p>



<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>M</strong>aybe buy more gold if it looks like Eliz. Warren will be elected. Put the gold under your mattress if it looks like Bernie will be elected.</p>



<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>E</strong>xplore foreign stocks with political uncertainty in the US.</p>



<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>D</strong>on&#8217;t get worked up if it dips. I expect the dip because elections are weird, but I don&#8217;t expect anything permanent. If you need to pull money out of investments this year, don&#8217;t put it in something that&#8217;s got decent dip potential. If you don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t worry about this year.</p>



<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>I</strong>nvest in small businesses directly, if you can.</p>



<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>B</strong>e a contrarian &#8211; think about 2nd and 3rd degree impacts of future trends and uncertainties. Continually look for data and information that will challenge your status quo decisions.</p>



<p>Thanks again to all the dads who participated. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how things shake out over the coming year, and hearing from you all again in 2021.</p>



<p>And to everyone else, remember, past dad performance is not indicative of future dad results. Take this opportunity to call your dad and talk to him about his portfolio.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">On January 26th, I had the idea for a new economic predictor that averages out that ever-illusive Dad Wisdom. Dad Wisdom seems to come at a great cost though. Blindspots that are themselves in blindspots. Dads don&#8217;t know what they don&#8217;t know, but you can&#8217;t tell them that.</p>



<p class="has-small-font-size">So, my thinking is that by aggregating Dad Wisdom on the future of the Economy, we should be able to either a) make sound investments in the coming year or b) find out the shared blindspots of Dads.</p>



<p class="has-small-font-size">The questions are as follows:</p>



<ol><li>Do you think the economy will get better or worse in the next 12 months?</li><li>Any changes you&#8217;re planning on making to your investments in the next 6 months?</li><li>How would you describe your appetite for risk?</li><li>How satisfied are you with your investment history?</li><li>Any other advice for the next 12 months?</li></ol>



<p class="has-small-font-size">I anticipate a lot of fun Dad answers to the last question, and will be quantifying the free-form answers to questions 3 and 4 as I see fit.</p>



<p class="has-small-font-size">As for the sample of Dads asked, they will be selected based on the following criteria:</p>



<ul><li>Is a Dad.</li><li>Has investments.</li><li>I either know them or at least one of their children.</li></ul>



<p class="has-small-font-size">The results will be anonymized prior to publishing.</p>



<p class="has-small-font-size">I am very excited.</p>



<p>For the ease of collecting the responses, <a href="/dad-economic-survey/">I&#8217;ve created a Google Form</a>. Which tells you about how well <a href="/2019/12/22/degoogling-1/">my efforts of De-Googling</a> have been going.</p>
