# Vitamins and Painkillers in 2023
## "Vitamin" software and systems become "Painkillers" as the economy slows

People buy painkillers more than they buy vitamins. Therefore, you should market your product or service as a painkiller.
That is to say, rather than promising to make your customer's life better, you should promise to _make their life less bad_.
Solve a problem, don't increase capability.

That's evergreen marketing advice 101. Human nature.
How can you apply it in today's economic situation?

When times were good and money was free (2008 through 2022), the problem was not making enough money.
Businesses had a long runway to establish themselves thanks to venture capitalists, generous terms at financial institutions, and 
the lack of alternatives for the large sums of cash being injected into the economy through QE (it had to go somewhere).

Now in 2023, belts are tightening, and the biggest concern is losing too much money.
The runway is ending, and businesses are dropping ballast as fast as they can without losing their wings.

This can be good news for "vitamin" products, just like scurvy is good news if you're selling Vitamin C.
_The past 15 years have made businesses deficient in Vitamin Efficiency._


Let's say you have a product that saves each employee 1% of their day, and costs less than 1% of total compensation.

Trying to make that pitch in 2022 was a vitamin. 1% time savings wouldn't translate to 1% increase in revenue.
But in 2023, 1% time savings for less than 1% of total compensation means offsetting the reduction in revenue.
A no-brainer.

The important goal here is a reduction in labor cost needed to maintain the same level of service.

Whether business owners are looking to hire cheaper labor and need to simplify their processes, or 
they need to reduce headcount and automate or outsource parts of their business, the name of the game is 
increased efficiency.


Where does this leave the painkillers of yesteryear, who promised wider reach and increased revenue?

Businesses still need to make money, but those painkiller sales teams should replace words like 
"grow" with "maintain", and bring hard data to the table that an $X spend will get the business at least $X+Y in revenue.
(Vitamin sellers are used to the data-backed sales approach.)


Finally, every business should be using this reorientation to prepare for the end of austerity.
An efficient business can rapidly scale.
Partnering with a business that can rapidly scale means that their spend with you can rapidly scale.
Now is the time to acquire new customers for your efficiency-increasing product or service, embed 
yourself in their efficient processes, and prepare to scale when the time comes.
