I've been thinking about trends in design and product design.

Specifically, Dieter Rams's tenth principle of good design, "Good design is as little design as possible."  

This flavor of minimalism has been around since at least WWII, but has become oppressive since the debut of the iPhone.  

Rams writes, "Back to simplicity. Back to purity. Less, but better."  

This correlates to his fifth principle, "Good design is unobtrusive."  
This raises the question, "What can design obstruct?"  

Since I already brought up the iPhone, let's start there.  
The focus of the smartphone is the screen. Its function as a phone has become secondary at best.  
You can see this in the reduction of buttons and bezels. To make room for what? The screen.  
What is the function of a screen? To display content.  

Let's briefly look at architecture.  
The trend for decades has been more glass on the outsides and less walls on the inside.  
Luckily, we can afford these changes thanks to advances in material science and engineering.  
What does removing walls and cladding make room for? Views and living.  

How about clothing?  
For men, hats were done by the 1960s. Suit jackets followed, then ties. Now it's acceptable to wear a t-shirt out and about.  
I won't speak to women's fashion, but the "leggings are pants" people seem to have won, which would have been unthinkable a few decades back.  
What has the removal of layers and ornamentation made room for? The person.  

Now to the point:  
When Dieter Rams wrote his principles, he was talking about designing quality products.  

Is the content available to us on our smartphones quality content that should be viewed without obstruction?  
Are the views out of our windows and the lives we lead within of such high quality that we should strive for such open spaces?  
Are we ourselves of such quality that we should hate to hide our physiques under layers of clothing?  

The obvious answer is no, but that's unfair.  

I see two ways out of this.  

1. Design could again become opinionated on how we live, look, and create.  
2. We could live, look, and create in a way that is worthy of an unobstructed view.  

However, both of these options rely on a willingness to enforce our own definitions of quality on the world around us, as either designers or consumers.  

Given the cycle since the 1960s of counter-cultural movement to neutering by social appeasement so as not to risk economic upheaval (see Occupy Wall Street),  
and the increasing frequency and reach of these movements, I don't expect the educated designer to dare imposing their will on their users.  
And given the rise of obesity and drug use, I don't expect that consumers as a whole are eager to impose standards upon themselves.  

I fear that unobtrusive design has laid bare the ugliness of our media, our communities, and ourselves, and that our solution has been to eradicate the  
concept of ugliness and refuse the possibility of objective quality.  

I don't know what the answer is, but I worry someone else might.
