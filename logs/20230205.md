Had a lazy morning.  
The boxspring arrived, so I assembled that and Annie helped me get it on the bed. The bed's tall now, but not too tall.  
Annie made oatmeal breakfast.  

## Grocery Store
Got in the car for the first time in a week and went to the North Liberty Hy-Vee.  
Such a better selection for us. Spent way more than we intended to, but it's all stuff we'll use ($60 alone for two giant paint cans of olive oil.)  
I was having a blast, until we saw a lone lobster in a tank. Humans are capable of such cruelty and callousness.  
Sure, they'll watch [_Blackfish_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackfish_(film)) and talk about how terrible SeaWorld is[^1], but won't 
think past that. Won't consider that any other creatures are worthy of consideration.  
Also found out that a mountain lion was shot west of Swisher here in Johnson County.  
From DNR's [own source](https://www.iowadnr.gov/Portals/idnr/uploads/education/visitors/mtn_lions_living.pdf) 66 people have been attacked by 
mountain lions in the past 110 years, and none of them were in Iowa.  
Surprise, it's still a bad time to be an animal when people are around.  

## Home
Put away groceries, Annie cooked.  
We hung out for an hour at 5:30 PM, and were sleepy enough to eat dinner in bed while we watched [_First Blood_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Blood).  
Dinner was lasagna soup.  
Went to bed early, but I couldn't really sleep, probably from hanging out in bed too much beforehand.  
Finally went to sleep around midnight.
