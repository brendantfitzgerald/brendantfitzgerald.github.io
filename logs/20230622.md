Can't believe it's been a week since the last update.  

6/21 Wednesday night Annie went to the studio, then we went to the Greenhouse, then La Wine Bar to support Doux Dieux Montana at an open mic.   
6/20 Tuesday was Trivia at The Vine.  
6/19 Monday was the studio, then dinner at BreadGarden, followed by The Grand Budapest Hotel at 7 PM with Leo, Khyla, and Chris Troyer.  
6/18 Sunday I called my dad and we practiced pinball with Leo at SpareMe
6/17 Saturday we walked downtown in the morning and were overwhelmed by the Pride happenings. Lots of people. SpareMe at night.  
6/16 Friday Dentist for some fillings. Annie had a productive meeting about the Needs Assessment.  

Good news: We heard the Vine is pursuing alternate amusement vendors. Still haven't heard back from my last email to the current guys.
