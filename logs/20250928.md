# Morning
Woke up kinda early, but hung around the house until meeting Alex, Kate, and Murphy at Kindred around 10 AM.

Came back home, had breakfast, then headed out for chores around 1 PM.

Went to Target, Quinton's, and Ace Hardware, then back to Quinton's because we didn't fix the problem with Star Trek pinball the first time.

# Evening
When we came back to Quinton's, there were people playing pinball, so we grabbed a beer to wait for them to get done.

Ended up talking to a fella named Chris. He's a trad Cath that lives in Terre Haute and is a contractor for CostCo maintenance.

Very interesting conversation. Must've stood there for 2 hours talking. Luckily I'd just been reviewing papal encyclicals.

Even though I've never been anywhere close to "trad", being able to speak a shared language of Catholicism was nice. (Even if 
he did insinuate a few times that Annie should quit her job and have babies.)

We did end up fixing Star Trek by replacing the trough optos and replacing the pinballs though. 
This was after trying a suggestion from Ryan to just bend the ejector plate. Lesson learned: try the easy fix, but be prepared to replace parts.

Then we came home, Annie FaceTimed her family and I made us macaroni and cheese.

She went to bed around 9, and I stayed up until 1 AM (it's getting worse) doing basically *nothing*. I guess I looked up some exercise routine stuff.
