# Morning
Some dreams overnight.

I was with people I hadn't seen since college, and didn't want to see, and I was underdressed for an opera (that turned out to be mostly pop music 
played by orchestra, probably because my brain can't make up opera). I tried to go change into other clothes in a locker room, but they were all occupied. 
So I left, and then shooting started. It was gangs of kids shooting at people. I shot two of them in self-defense. There were more details, but those were 
the highlights.

Not to rationalize too much, but both my college and my high school are having their reunions/homecomings soon, and between *Escape from L.A.* in which a 
character is killed by a gang of children, and the Charlie Kirk killing yesterday, I probably have violence on the brain. Maybe the opera was just a 
manifestation of social anxiety after an evening of socializing with new people in their own environment which was completely foreign to me.

Annie's not feeling well. Proably picked it up at the movies or the club fair. Who knows?

Work started off with another whirlwind, but calmed down pretty quickly. I have some documents to write for 2026 projects, and initial documentation 
on a project to enforce standard formatting and validation on the Transaction String of manually-entered GL Transactions, but that should be easy.
