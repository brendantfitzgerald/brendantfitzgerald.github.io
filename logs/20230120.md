## Work
Talked to Annie. Concerning family news. Nothing permanent, but nerve-wracking nonetheless.  
She'll be going to Kansas instead of coming home.  
We're trying to figure out if/when I meet her there. I've got my wisdom teeth surgery on Tuesday, and it's Test Week 
for our the core conversion from the acquisition.  
I worked until 5:45 due to lost records from Salesforce merge.  

## Home
Talked to Baker for a bit. He's sick.  
Had a beer and a glass of Jelly Bean Row wine from Canada (it was really good, but probably even better in Summer.)  
Went to bed early and just watched YouTube until like midnight.
