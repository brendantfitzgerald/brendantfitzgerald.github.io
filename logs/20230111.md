## Work
Had my 1-on-1 today. Getting a 3% raise for 2023. Which is nice, because I expected 0%.  

## Hy-Vee
Went shopping for cat litter and cat food.  
Listened to _The Pinball Show_ podcast while I drove and shopped.  
Also bought a bunch of stuff, including things I had coupons for.  
Forgot to scan the coupons at checkout.  
But I did scan my Fuelsaver barcode from my phone, then used Apple Pay to pay. Testing out what it would be like to not carry a wallet.  

## Home
Put away food.  
Annie made an artichoke grilled cheese with fries from Purple Carrot.  
I played _Super Smash Bros. Melee_ and unlocked Dr. Mario. I also consistently lose to level 8 CPUs. But barely.  
Thinking about getting a better Gamecube controller. Mine are from 2001 and feel mushy.  
We watched the Finale of _The Great Pottery Throwdown_. In these later series, it becomes obvious who's going to win within the last 4 or 5 episodes.  
We also watched ["The Quilting Bee" episode of _The Great American Quilt_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5ZB8kpfqXA).  
Found out from Avery that SpareMe will be selling Tron, The Jetsons, and Asteroids, and replacing them with 2 basketball games, and 2 dart boards.  
Went to bed kind of late, and read _The Dispossessed_.
