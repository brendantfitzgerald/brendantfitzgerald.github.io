Exercise bike at lunch 6.5 mi/22 min while watching _Berserk_.  
Ate shepherd's pie for lunch and dinner, also watching _Berserk_.  
Talked to Annie.  
Took a shower.  
Talked to Baker.  
Leo and Khyla decided not to got to Late Shift at The Grindhouse's showing of _Night of The Bastard_ because of the weather.  
That's great for me because I was already sleepy.  
Had a dream that either Mulder from _The X-Files_ or my dad was showing me an alternate reality with a bunch of demons and an alternate layout 
to our basement. It was nice.
