Had a *very* lazy morning to prepare for the evening's festivities.  
Went to the co-op to pick up some things for New Year's breakfast.  
The pinball bar crawl was good. Troyer, Mickey, and Adam and Jyoti all joined us at different points.  
Mickey and I killed a solenoid on South Park at Deadwood.  
We decided not to go to Joystick because there was a huge cover for comedy and karaoke to get into the basement.  
SpareMe was too good as usual.
