# Morning
Work. (Writing this two days later, is it obvious?)

# Evening
I drove up to a happy hour at Field Day in North Liberty to say goodbye to Sara Wilson. 
She's got a new job as head of IT for an insurance company in Dubuque.

Annie talked to Nicole Beau on the phone around 9, and I was beat from a busy week of work and socializing, so I just watched *The Simpsons* 
and ate crackers and hummus in bed.
