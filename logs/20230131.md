## Work
Testing continues.  
Had my Year-End Review. Got the highest level possible.  
What I took to be "not getting attention" was spun as a positive of "not requiring check-ins to be kept on-track".  
Had the chance to talk about why Testing week is now Testing week_s_.
Worked until 5:45 PM.  

## Home
Annie went to the pottery studio before I got off work.  
So I did a bit of tidying up, fed the cats, cleaned the litter box, while I talked to Baker.  
Then I went to trivia at The Vine.  

## Trivia
Max and his friends Chris and Scott were there, so we joined their team.  
It was a tough first half, but Scott pulled through on Sports, Chris knew Deep Blue Something, and Annie killed it on Harry Potter.  
The final wager was about who was the first villain on the original Scooby Doo show. I guessed the Black Knight. Correctly.  

## Home
Was a little drinky night, so we had tater tots when we got home and watched Wizard People, Dear Reader.  
Went to bed and read _The Dispossessed_ until I fell asleep. About 90% of the way through now.
