## Work
Conversion day!  
Annie packed me so much food in preparation for a late night.  
Time just flew by and we really got a ton done.  
We were joking about being done by 10 PM.  
We were out before 6 PM.  

## Home
Got home, talked to Baker for a bit, then went to Filmscene to see if there were any tickets left for [_Twilight_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_(2008_film)).

## The Chauncey
We'd bought tickets to _Twilight_ weeks in advance, but I couldn't make it because of work, so Annie took Khyla. Luckily they added a second showing the following Monday. 
Annie and I have tickets to that.  
No tickets to be had, so I went to SpareMe, ran into Annie and Khyla, then they went to the movie, so I talked to Mickey and met his brother, Steve.  
They left, so I went to the upstairs bar and hung out with Leo and Max until the girls were out of the movie.  
Too much beer, but I had fun.  

## Home
Ate food and went to bed eventually.
