Workday.  
Lifted at lunch.  
Rode my bike to pick up vegan croissants from Valerie's French Cooking on Muscatine Ave at 3 PM.  
  I ordered chocolate and raspberry croissants for Annie's birthday. Riding my bike and picking up French pastries was fun.  
We returned [_The Oak Park Studio_](https://search.icpl.org/Record/1746149) by Frank Lloyd Wright to the Library.  
Annie made a curry for dinner and apple crumble for dessert.  
I finished ripping The Addams Family complete series for addition to the home server.  
We watched _The Great Pottery Throwdown_ as we ate dinner, then some _Joe Pera Talks To You_ because we had cats on us.  
I started reading [_The Dispossessed_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dispossessed) by Ursula K. Le Guin before bed.
