Watched the IFPA Pinball Women's State Championship for Massachusetts.  
Intended to watch just until Iowa started streaming, but that didn't happen and I got invested in the Massachusetts players.  
Finally copied Ratnest onto a Hard Drive for Adam.  
Realized we were out of labels for the label maker. Found out that there were some at the Downtown Target.  

## Downtown
Called Baker for a bit as I walked.  
Returned the second disk of _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ Season 1 to the Library.  
Bought labels at Target.  
Went to SpareMe to drop off the Hard Drive, RATPACK_04, to Adam.  

## SpareMe
Played Iron Maiden mostly.  
Ran into Chris Troyer. Told him about the upcoming tournament.  
Had some beers, played Deadpool and Star Wars to try and prepare for the tournament myself.

Made myself a new nightcap creation that I think Annie will like.
* One mug of Chamomile Tea
* One shot gin (Prairie Gin is nice and smooth for this)
* One shot St. Germain  

Drank that as I watched the beginning of [_Batman: Mask of The Phantasm_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_Mask_of_the_Phantasm) in bed.
