Marty was a terror, so Annie slept in the closet until 9 AM.  
He woke me up at 7.  
Hung out with Annie, tried rearranging the furniture a little.  

## Downtown
It got up to 46 degrees today.  
Got coffee at Daydrink and walked by the river. Saw 4 or 5 bald eagles as well as Anna and her boyfriend (husband?).    
Swung by the Co-op on the way home for garlic powder, and walked out with a bunch of stuff that was on sale.  

## Home
Annie sewed the blanket for the ottoman into a slip cover, and went to the pottery studio around 5:30 PM.
I talked to Baker for a while, and played Tetris Attack.  

## Downtown
I met Annie at the studio around 7 PM.  
Got to sand a mug and help attach handles.  
We met Mickey at Double Tap at 7:30 PM, played some pinball and went to SpareMe when the place got crowded.  
Late night though, we were out until after 11 PM.  

## Home
Made tater tots, and I showed Annie ["The Northern Boys"](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/northern-boys-party-time-tiktok-rap-1234598288/).  
Went to bed, and couldn't bring myself to read non-fiction, so I started in on rereading [_Spook Country_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spook_Country).
