## Home
Woke up to the kids watching _Bluey_.  
Annie had come up to sleep on the couch around 2 AM because the air mattress was so cold in the basement.  

## Downtown
Drove down to Bread Garden for lunch.  
The kids played on the playground and saw the 
[giant bunnies](https://web.archive.org/web/20230130205443/https://downtowniowacity.com/new-winter-light-experience-this-february-downtown/).  
Came back home for naps which didn't happen.  
Then drove back downtown to go bowling at SpareMe.  
Bridget won by a pin, and the kids were surprisingly OK at pinball. I have a nice photo of Annie coaching them.  

## Home
Came back to make up for the naps.  
The girls went to Target to get Bobby a birthday gift.  
I ordered [The Wedge](https://web.archive.org/web/20230220190608/http://thewedgepizza.com/) pizza. Vegan and decidedly not. Blegh.  
We ate pizza, watched _PJ Masks_ and then put the kids to bed.  
We played [Mountain Goats](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/305985/mountain-goats), 
then Katie went to bed, and we played [Fluxx](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/258/fluxx) with Bobby.
