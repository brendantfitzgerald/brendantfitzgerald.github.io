## Work
Post-conversion begins. Plenty of issues, but nothing like last time.  

## Downtown
Early Valentine's Day date!  
Left immediately for Bread Garden at 5 to get burritos.  
Stayed there until 6:30, when we went to the Chauncey.  
Played The Jetsons pinball until 6:50.  

## Filmscene
Then, finally, I got to see [_Twilight_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_(2008_film)) in 35mm.  
Great time, great crowd.  
I really think the color-grading was better on the original 35mm theatrical release than any of the home video releases. It made _Twilight_ feel like a movie 
instead of a cultural phenomenon in film form. Maybe it will get the [Harmy's Despecialized Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmy%27s_Despecialized_Edition) 
treatment some day.

## SpareMe
Went back to SpareMe afterwards. Played some Star Wars pinball. I got my second best, just beating Avery's personal best again.  
We were there too late, and inspired a bunch of other ladies to stay late. Poor Adam and co.  

## Home
Came home, Annie finished her burrito and I had my Sloppy Joes from Saturday.
