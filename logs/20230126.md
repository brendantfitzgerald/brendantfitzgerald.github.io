## Kansas City
Watched niece while everyone else was out.  
Easy kid. _PJ Masks_ and coloring and we're set.  

I worked from 8 until 5:30.  
Played with the kids more, had dinner, and watched _Slow Horses_.  

Couldn't fall asleep until 1 AM.  
Played _Vampire Survivors_ instead of reading like a responsible person.
