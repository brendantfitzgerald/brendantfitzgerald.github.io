# Labor Day Pinball Tournament in Peosta, IA
Left about 10 AM and got back around 10 PM.
First time back at Jay's in about 18 months. Saw their new addition.
Played in 2 pinball tournaments, didn't do well in either, but it was a tough crowd.
Drove back with Ryan Jerred, Sam Wiley, and Doug Tye. Zaden Issah and Harry Nelsen were still playing when we left.
Didn't get to sleep until about 1 AM. Needed some time to myself.
