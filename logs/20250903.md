# Morning
Woke up late-ish again. Took the managers' call on the porch because Annie had another call.

Someone was touring 528 S Lucas St. Wonder if they'll buy it.

I made a quick poster for the pinball tournament at SpareMe tonight.

Also, I became a moderator of the Iowa City subreddit. Need to ask them about rules & expectations.

Annie's beginner ballet class was sold out. She didn't sign up originally because SpareMe was supposed to do a pinball league on Mondays this Fall.
Also, a fella who was interested in renting our 2nd 12ft Skeleton decided to just buy one.
We should probably just set the other one up. Make our house look like the [Argonath](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Argonath).

Timeguessr: 44,206 (Was within a kilometer of 4/5, but the years were rough)

# Afternoon

# Thoughts
Feeling better than I did on Monday. Social exhaustion, which I need to remember colors *everything* a little darker.
Of course, tonight I'm assisting Annie in running the tournament, so I might need to recover again again. We'll see.
