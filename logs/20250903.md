# Morning
Woke up late-ish again. Took the managers' call on the porch because Annie had another call.

Someone was touring 528 S Lucas St. Wonder if they'll buy it.

I made a quick poster for the pinball tournament at SpareMe tonight.

Also, I became a moderator of the Iowa City subreddit. Need to ask them about rules & expectations.

Annie's beginner ballet class was sold out. She didn't sign up originally because SpareMe was supposed to do a pinball league on Mondays this Fall.
Also, a fella who was interested in renting our 2nd 12ft Skeleton decided to just buy one.
We should probably just set the other one up. Make our house look like the [Argonath](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Argonath).

Timeguessr: 44,206 (Was within a kilometer of 4/5, but the years were rough)

## Pinball Tournament
I assisted Annie in running the pinball tournament. It went well. Only 45 players, but at least 3 of them were new to competitive pinball.

I didn't play well at all until the end. Not sure why. But playing host even more than usual was fun for me.

The right vertical upkicker failed on Venom during play though. Luckily it was just a disconnected wire to the solenoid, and Ryan Jerred was able to fix it quickly.
I need to buy a nicer soldering iron. His heated up so quickly!

I also learned that the setting "Coin Door Ball Saver" is supposed to save your ball if it drains while the coin door is open.
Harry said it's not reliable, but it's better than nothing.

## Maniac Cop 2
After the tournament, we watched Maniac Cop 2 at FilmScene's Late Shift at the Grindhouse. 
We only intended to watch a bit, but ended up staying through the whole 90 minutes.

I've never seen the first Maniac Cop, but I think the sequel is a perfect movie. 
Plenty of action and practical effects, never lulls, exposition is handled well, the acting's totally competent, and the characters are almost all tastefully handled. 
Which is incredible given the amount of breasts on screen.
I'll have to go watch it again, but I think it may even pass the Bechdel test.

There's nothing I could cut or change, which is rare!

# Thoughts
Feeling better than I did on Monday. Social exhaustion, which I need to remember colors *everything* a little darker.
Of course, tonight I'm assisting Annie in running the tournament, so I might need to recover again again. We'll see.
