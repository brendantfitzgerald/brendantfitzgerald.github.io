Watched _PJ Masks_ with the kids, had coffee and chatted.  

## Mass
Went to St. Mary's for the 10:30 AM mass.  
The gospel was about turning the other cheek, doing more than asked for people that press you into service, and giving mroe than asked to the poor.  
This one is difficult. Have to view it through the lens of an eternal afterlife for it to make sense.  

## Home
Katie, Bobby and co. left for Kansas after mass.  
Annie and I had a beer.  
I vacuumed and took a shower, Annie talked to her folks.  
Then Annie showered and fell asleep in bed.  
I cleaned up a bit more, then fell asleep on the couch.  
Around 7, we woke up, had macaroni and [cheese](https://web.archive.org/web/20230220185645/https://daiyafoods.com/our-foods/sauce/cheddar-sauce/) with 
[tuno](https://web.archive.org/web/20230109133450/https://atlanticnaturalfoods.com/plant-based-brands/tuno/) for dinner.  
Then we went back to bed at 9.
