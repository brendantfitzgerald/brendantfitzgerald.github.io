Lazy morning.  
Read in bed and talked about our trailer, _The Three Body Problem_, and Kindles/Libby generally. 

Mailed coffee, cat toys, and a copy of The Little Village to Adam and Carla, and talked about electric-assist bike trailers.  
Bought Command Strips at Target.  
Picked up some art from the Library.[^1]  
Annie didn't have her Library card, so we'll need to go back to get something for the office and living room.  

I called Baker when I got home and we talked for a few hours while Annie and I separately tidied up the house. (Putting away Christmas decorations mostly.)  
Annie cooked Bombay Potatoes from Purple Carrot, and I made myself useful by playing [_Super Smash Bros. Melee_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros_Melee).  
We watched an Only Connect while we ate.  

We went to SpareMe to play pinball. Avery's back from Newfoundland and was nice enough to bring us hats back as souvenirs.  
I beat Mickey for Grand Champion on Stranger Things (286,115,820). Was playing like trash all night, then Max stopped by my table and my luck totally changed.
Have to keep that in mind.  
Annie was having a good night with Iron Maiden. Might consider that for a home machine if we ever get one.  

We left SpareMe around 9 PM because I had to pick Anthony up from the airport at 10 PM. He was back from seeing Andrea off in New Haven, Connecticut.  
That all went smoothly, and I stepped in to his apartment to check out his [rowing machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20230107133803/https://hydrow.com/products/rowers/hydrow-wave/)
It's very nice, and while I wouldn't spend as much right off the bat, I'm definitely curious about getting one.  
Came home around 11:30 PM, Annie'd made a delicious casserole for second dinner, and then I goofed off until like 1 AM watching Youtube.
