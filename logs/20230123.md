## Log
### Work
First day of SilverLake Test Week.  
Didn't stop for breakfast or lunch. Worked until 6:30 PM.  
Eh.  

### Home
Ate a bunch of stuff to make up for earlier.  
Talked to Annie twice.  
Leo and Khyla agreed to take our tickets to The Thing on Wednesday.  
Just watched YouTube videos and read Hacker News and stuff.  

## Thoughts on Scrum
Was reading about Scrum in support teams. General advice was, "Don't do Scrum for support. Use Kanban."[^1]  
Currently, over half of my time (65%) is reserved for unplannable Production Support.  
The next most popular advice was to designate one person to be "Support" for the sprint.  
That would probably work for teams with highly-integrated goals, but that's not my situation.  
The people who actually cover my responsibilities when I'm out aren't on my new team. (They were on my old team.)  

I'm curious to find companies that do organizational change management well.  
Most of the places I've been seem to make a change and then let things kind of "shake out".  
Maybe an organization that can expend that much energy on internal structure is overbuilt and will be cut.  
Especially nowadays.
