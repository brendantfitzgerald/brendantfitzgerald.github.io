## Work
Productive first half of the day.  
Got a "hey, let me know when you have a second to chat" message around 3 with no further details, so the rest of my day was shot worrying.  
Turned out to not be anything.  

## Home/Errands
Annie went to the studio and I ran a bunch of errands.  
Bought dry cat food. (Small bag, everywhere's out of the big bags of our brand at the moment.)  
Bought new windshield wipers for the Subaru.  
Got a car wash at Club Car Wash on Highway 1.  
Installed the new wipers at home.  

## SpareMe
Met Annie at SpareMe around 8.  
We played pinball terribly, but we were pre-occupied talking about the possible sale/swap of Jetsons for Baywatch and Space Jam.  
Also, if we have 1 credit left, we've taken to playing [Stall Ball](https://pinside.com/pinball/forum/topic/what-exactly-is-stall-ball).  

## Home
Left at 9:45, came home, ate dinner and watched an episode of Joe Pera.
