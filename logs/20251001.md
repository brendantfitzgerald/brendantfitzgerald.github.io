# Morning
Manager meeting, some business requirements for Portfolio Analytics, etc.

Also, the "Retrospective" for our "Scrum" team is about to change a bit because notes will be provided to the admins' supervisors.

This is not Scrum, not that it ever has been. Retrospective is a meeting among peers. There should be some safety of privacy to prevent a chilling effect.

Glad I'm able to push back now without worrying too much about repercussions.

# Evening
## Pinball Tournament
I took first in the pinball tournament and had a blast doing it.

It was random pairing (which helps explain why I took first), but it's legitimate! And I've *always* advocated for random pairing because it 
lets you play with people that you may not have met, regardless of how they're doing in this particular tournament.

Also, Cody McQuiston announced that
1. Iowa is a super-state for IFPA. (We've had enough tournament players this year that we get a 24-player finals instead of 16.)
2. The State Championship Tournament will be held at SpareMe.

Very exciting all around (and I *could* actually qualify for States if I keep playing well.)

## *Heavy Traffic*
Watched this movie at FilmScene afterwards, and boy do I regret it. Just a kinda miserable movie.

Called Baker afterwards and realized that basically all the media from the '70s is miserable.
