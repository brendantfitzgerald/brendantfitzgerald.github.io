Dropped Annie off at the airport around 5:30 AM. She's going to Hartford, Connecticut for her group's annual meeting.  
She's also visiting Andrea at New Haven, and her cousin Anne and her friend Eva in New York.  

Came home and had breakfast. Saw that it was going to get up to 54 degrees today, so decided I'd try rehanging the front door.  
What a mistake.  

Everything's solid wood. Nothing has worn out or shifted as far as I can tell.  
The hinges are solid iron. No chance that I can bend them.  
Weatherstripping is the answer.  

Also, the batteries for my drill are dead, so I need to get a converter because DeWalt changed their design a while ago.

Took my bike out to put air in the tires around 2 PM and went for a ride around downtown and the Northside.  
I need to secure those bucket panniers better. And add some more lights maybe? Looking forward to Spring.  

After that, started watching the original _Berserk_ anime. It's about as "dark" as I care for. The manga is too much.  
But it was also made for teen boys in Japan, and I bet I would've loved it when I was younger.  

Anthony was back from Minnesota, so we hit up SpareMe to play some pinball and shoot the shit.  
I'm feeling more confident about Iron Maiden. Now it's just practice.  
Also, beat my personal best on Stranger Things again, now it's 324 million.  

Came home and fell asleep watching _Berserk_.  

Tomorrow, Anthony and I are planning on going to trivia at The Vine,  
but I might swing by SpareMe first to test out some tournament stuff with Avery. Pinball Tournament, Feb 8th.
