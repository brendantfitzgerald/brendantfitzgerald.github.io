Annie's birthday!  
She slept maybe 2 hours though, so not a fun day for her.  
We initially planned to get dinner at Thai Flavors, then hang out at SpareMe until _Hard Ticket to Hawaii_ started at FilmScene.  
Unfortunately, with her lack of sleep, we decided to just get takeout from Thai Flavors.  
I got her a Fuji Instax Printer and the croissants that I picked up yesterday.  
Annie's parents sent her flowers, and her sister FaceTimed so that she and her kids could wish Annie a happy birthday.  
We watched an episode of _Great Pottery Throwdown_ and called it an early night.
