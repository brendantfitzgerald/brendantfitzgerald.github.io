Annie's birthday!  
She slept maybe 2 hours though, so not a fun day for her.  
We initially planned to get dinner at Thai Flavors, then hang out at SpareMe until _Hard Ticket to Hawaii_ started at FilmScene.  
Unfortunately, with her lack of sleep, we decided to just get takeout from Thai Flavors.  
I got her a Fuji Instax Printer and the croissants that I picked up yesterday.  
Annie's parents sent her flowers, and her sister FaceTimed so that she and her kids could wish Annie a happy birthday.  
We watched an episode of _Great Pottery Throwdown_ and called it an early night.

But also, I got obsessed with AI developments.  
I truly think that we're going to need a massive reorganization of our society sooner than we think.  
Universal Basic Income is probably just the first step.  

I see it going like this:  
* Coming recession destroys a lot of relatively cushy jobs.  
* AI companies begin offering AI as a replacement for the lost productivity.  
* Jobs taken by AI won't return.  

Maybe we fall ass-backwards into a Universal Basic Income when enough white-collar workers are on the dole.  
But it doesn't answer more pressing questions about what humans should do.  
How can we take pride in our work knowing that our employers would and will replace us with a machine once it's feasible?  
It can't just be a restructuring of our economy, but of all of society.  
The most important question being "How will the new system ensure that plumbers, janitors, and garbage collectors are still willing to do their jobs?"  
As usual, I worry that the answer will be an authoritarian in nature.
