Worked out, hung out with Annie.  
She was feeling stressed about her upcoming travel, so we gave each other some space.  
Went to the Co-op for snacks and a copy of the Gazette. (For the crossword. They were out.)  
Came home, snuggled up and watched an episode of _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ and called it an early night 
because we had to leave very early for the airport the next morning.
