## Work
Post-conversion continues.  
I had to do three things today that apparently had documented procedures, but I didn't find them in either of the Knowledge Bases.  
Bad documentation isn't worse than no documentation. Bad organization is worse than no documentation.  

## Home
Texted Anthony to see if he wanted to grab drinks or dinner. Ended up picking him up from U-Haul in Coralville a little after 5.  
We met up again at 6:30 and all walked over to Aljimbre.  
They were out of Dos Equis and Modelo, so I got Pacifico.  
Anthony and I ordered Mushroom Tlayuda. Annie got a Caesar Salad.  
It was a nice atmosphere, but expensive.  
I spilled water all over the table at the end of the night.  
We went home, and pretty much went right to bed.
