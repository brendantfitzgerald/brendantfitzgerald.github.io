## Work
Busy busy.  
Did 8.5 miles on the bike in 30 minutes while watching [_The Corporation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Corporation_(2003_film))

## Home
Annie had the last Art Office happy hour at 6 PM, and was researching our house's history until then.  
I talked to Baker until about 8 PM.  
Annie and I had dinner (leftovers) and watched [_Repo Man_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repo_Man_(film)), then went to bed early.
