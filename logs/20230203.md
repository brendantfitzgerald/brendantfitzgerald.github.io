## Work
Busy busy.  
Did 8.5 miles on the bike in 30 minutes while watching [_The Corporation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Corporation_(2003_film))

## Home
Annie had the last Art Office happy hour at 6 PM, and was researching our house's history until then.  
I talked to Baker until about 8 PM.  
Annie and I had dinner (leftovers) and watched [_Repo Man_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repo_Man_(film)), then went to bed early.

## AI God in Eden
_"IT Club" Discord, #stupid-arguments-and-crazy-ideas_
AI will return humanity to stewardship of another entity's creations.  
A possible return to Eden, if humans stop trying to emulate God's power to create and instead focus on maintenance and responsible consumption of the creations.  

Also, creating a sentient (enough) entity trained on the collective knowledge of humanity sounds a little like being raised from the dead and becoming one with God.  
Although I don't think any religion has said "publish or perish" when it comes to heaven...  

## Credit Cards
_"IT Club" Discord, #money_
I'm feeling weird about Credit Cards lately.  
Literally the only reason it is a net positive for me is because it's a net negative for others.  
Like, if everyone used credit cards the way I use credit cards, the credit card issuer would lose money.  

I’m talking about buying apples at (cost - x) where it’s offset by a class of people paying (cost + 2x). These people would pay (cost - x) if they could, but either through bad luck or bad decisions, they’re subsidizing me.
