# Morning
Coordinated testing for a Symitar warning code and a DNS change to support the nCino/SilverLake integration.

Watched the Apple keynote for the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and Air. Consensus is that the Air is a precursor to a foldable. Otherwise, meh.

Noticed there's grass growing from the dead branch of the old oak tree in our backyard. Funny side effects of birds and squirrels, I'm sure.

# Evening
Went to go see *Sanjuro* at FilmScene at 4 PM.

It was good, and a fun juxtaposition as a sequel to *Escape from L.A.*

We got home by 7 though, which really threw the evening off.

Annie and I watched *Only Connect* for the first time in ages. I was doing well until apparently the word "Muppetational" appears in the Muppet Show theme.

## *Seveneves*
Finished *Seveneves* by Neal Stephenson. Probably my least favorite book of his yet. It should have been a series like *Foundation*. 
The characters were too numerous to connect with, but too few for a larger entity (like a community or the human race as a whole) to be the protagonist.
I'm surprised he didn't split the timelines like he did with *Cryptonomicon*, but I bet it's difficult to get the pacing right. 
And as-written, the first 50% of the book is just setting up the rest. I could cut the book in half and replace either half with a one-page summary of events.
