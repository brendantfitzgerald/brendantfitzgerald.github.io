## Home
Dad and Kyle arrived around 6:40 AM with coffee.  
We talked while drinking our coffee, and they went to sleep in their closets[^1] before 8.  

## Work
Annie and I worked from the dining room table.  
The guys woke up around Noon.  
Annie made a keto-friendly green curry with some no-carb noodles.  
I finished up my calls and went to walk downtown with the guys at 2:30 PM.  

## Downtown
Mailed some packages, saw the giant inflatable rabbits on the Ped Mall, and grabbed some coffee drinks at Java House.  
Went to SpareMe around 4 to practice some before the tournament.  

## SpareMe
Albert and Avery were putting the final touches on the machines as we arrived. They played faster than ever.  
Before the tournament, I managed to put up almost 2.2 Billion points on Star Wars. Why couldn't that have happened _during_ the tournament?!  
The most important part of the tournament is that [Annie beat me, placing 9th. I got 13th](https://next.matchplay.events/tournaments/94637), 
only thanks to a win on Jetsons.  
Chris Troyer won overall, and Mickey got 6th. So at least I beat my Dad and Kyle.  
But I also didn't get to play Stranger Things, Star Trek, or Jurassic Park, which are the three tables I've put the most time on.  
Still, what a blast. A really really good time.  
We left late, drank way too much, and paid for it the next day.  


[^1]: The closets in the office are perfect for sleeping, especially during the day.
