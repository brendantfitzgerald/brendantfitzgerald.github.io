Woke up feeling crummy.  
Hung out with Annie for a while, which helped. Then showered.  
Did a bit of cleaning around the house.  
Annie made a shepherd's pie.  
I reinstalled youtube-dl on the home server and downloaded some frequently-watched videos.  
We hung out some more, then Annie went to the studio.  
I called Baker, and talked until around 7 when I met Annie at the studio.  

## Downtown
Sometimes I help Annie sand her pottery after the bisque firing.  
This time, all the pieces sat flat, and there was hardly any sanding to do at all.  
Turns out she'd started burnishing after throwing, and also after trimming.  Quite the difference!  
We went to SpareMe afterwards.  
Had 3 beers each, played Star Wars, Jetsons, and Stranger Things, but the drop-target bank on Stranger Things is all goofed up.  
Left at 10.  

## Home
Came home, ate shepherd's pie and watched the first half of [_They Live_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They_Live).
