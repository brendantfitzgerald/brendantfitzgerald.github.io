Worked.  
Got an email from my aunt.  
Decided on a quiet night to prepare for our New Year's Eve Pinball Bar Crawl tomorrow night.

Watched [Red Letter Media Nukie Episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbdij5Vi8oY)  
Went to bed early and read more of The Big Sleep. 61% or so of the way through. Really enjoying it.
