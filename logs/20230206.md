## Work
Tough having to explain how I've spent my time, and also my reduced ability to plan for the next sprint.  
Read online that your sprints for Agile should match how often your priorities can change. So... 2 hour sprints for me (I wish).  
Was absolutely drained by the end of the day because I spent all day on calls.  
Clocked out at 5:30 PM.  

## Home
Lasagna soup for dinner and we watched [PAPA Pinball's Deadpool Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZMPyTqiot4) while we ate.  

## Downtown
Walked to the co-op to see if the Gardein holiday roasts were back on sale. They were not.  
Bought 5 avocados and a bottle of liquid aminos.  
Then we went to SpareMe to practice pinball.  

## SpareMe
Adam let us borrow a bunch of movies. Good collection.  
Harry was also working, and we ran into Avery and Natasha.  
Avery checked on his hives today, and the bees are alive and well. Natasha's looking for work.  
We played Star Wars with Avery. Annie and he did will. I hate that machine.  
Left at 7:15 so that Annie could call her parents at 7:30.  

## Home
Annie cooked a bit and sewed while she talked to her parents.  
I wasted time on that stupid Vampire Survivors game.  
We ate more dinner around 9 PM, and watched [PAPA Pinball's Jurassic Park Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVs_0jqCPGA).  
Annie went to bed early, I finished the video and goofed around until almost 11 PM.
