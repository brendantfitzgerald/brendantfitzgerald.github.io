# Morning

Didn't really wake up until almost 8 AM.
Texted Rob Decker to see if he wanted Star Wars Home Edition Plus for his breakroom instead of Silverball Mania with the RetroPin Upgrade code.
He did.

Alex and Kate Koppel invited us to the Quad Cities on Saturday to go look at/pick up an organ, but that's when we're doing a pinball machine rotation.
JAWS to SpareMe, Foo Fighters to a private rental, Star Wars Home Edition Plus to Axiom, and Halloween to FilmScene.

Found a [nice blog post](https://borretti.me/article/notes-on-managing-adhd) on ADHD management, that got me excited to start journaling here again.
We'll see if I can stick it.

# Afternoon
Not much more happened at work.

Around 7, we went out to SpareMe to clean the pinball machines. Talked to Mickey, *Battleship* (2012) was on the TV. Looked bad.
We were done by 9:30, came home, and we both stayed up until like 1 AM again. Think it's just catching up on "nothing" time.

# Thoughts
Been a bit of a spendy mood lately, (iPad Air M3 with Pencil Pro for Annie, and a Macbook Air M4 for me). I'm not sure why.
I think part of it is to remove tooling from the equation when it comes to project success/failure.
After "making do" unnecessarily for years (possibly upwards of 30 years), I just want to spend some money and get things that work.
But another part of me suspects that it's the monkey drive to acquire shiny things.
