# Morning
Had a good chat with my manager, Aaron this morning just checking in. I forgot that I'm one of his 5 direct reports, so 
he's expecting to spend ~20% of his time on my stuff. I think it will end up being drastically more or less than that, 
depending on how you measure "my stuff". The technical side doesn't happen in a vacuum, so I'll always be touching 
something that touches somebody else's stuff. Of course, I didn't think to say that at the meeting.

Timeguessr: 48,518

Actually got some stuff done in SilverLake without IT's involvement. Which is good because they literally have 
zero hours for my projects in the next two weeks, and very few hours in the two weeks following because of a 
hackathon, Dreamforce, and the Universal App deployment.

This *does not work* AND WOULD BE FIXED IF THEY DID KANBAN INSTEAD OF SCRUM.
BECAUSE SCRUM IS FOR DEVELOPERS. NOT. ADMINS. WHO. DO. SUPPORT.

Really glad I'm back in the Commercial Department.
