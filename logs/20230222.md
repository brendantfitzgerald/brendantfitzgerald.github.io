## Sleep
Had a dream that I was trying to help my dad pack up his truck to go to a job, while also trying to get my mom ready to 
drive to the airport to move to Ireland. That sucked, but it was fun to visit the old house again. Everything where I remembered, obviously.  

## Work
Opened up my inbox and realized how out of it I still was. But I got better as the day progressed.  
Had 3 hours of calls. Can't tell you what use any of them were.  
I attend meetings defensively, because I can't trust that anyone will realize if/when something will affect my systems.  
Annie did 8 miles in 30 minutes on the exercise bike. Very impressive!  

## Downtown
Went downtown to buy deodorant.  
Basic Goods is supposed to close at 6, so we hustled, but we got down there at 5:20 and the lights were off.  
So, went to Target instead. Lots of the paper-packaged deodorants were gone or on clearance. I hope they're just going to replace them.  
We decided to stop in to Double Tap for a spell.  
We played Legends of Valhalla, which Annie really enjoyed, and I liked so much better than before.  
Also played Cactus Canyon, the Mandalorian, and Black Rose.  
They're doing a week of challenges on Guitar Hero, and boy did I fail La Grange at 45%.  
I also got to try the Big Grove Citrus Surfer, which the GM of Double Tap likened to a split Blue Moon and Leinenkugel Summer Shandy.  
He wasn't wrong.  

## Home
Got home, ate chicken and dumplings that Annie'd prepared for the weekend.  
Watched an Only Connect, then some Youtube nonsense because Annie started feeling unwell.  
Went to bed at 10 PM. Didn't read, just slept.
