# Morning
They caught the guy who killed Charlie Kirk, which is one of the topics that Baker and I talked about last night.

Other than that, just meetings this morning and work around work.

The new Stern Star Wars pinball machine, "Fall of The Empire" was revealed today too. I was in a webinar at noon for operators.

It's the first Spike 3 machine, which promises a lot of improvements, but... meh. 
I'm sure it'll be fun to play, but did we really need *another* pin where you go to Tattooine and Hoth and Endor?

I worry that Stern's losing their touch on themes. You wouldn't necessarily want to go back to the SAM II or Whitestar days, but 
machines don't need anything technically novel to be fun. Foo Fighters Pro didn't have any weird mechs, just good shots. 
Same with JAWS Pro (the reel maybe though?) and Pulp Fiction.

And those games were praised for theme integration.

Barrels of Fun, Spooky, and Jersey Jack are blowing it up for theme integration *and* novel mechs, but I also can't justify buying them as an operator.
They're for home.

If only Homepin games had better layouts, I think they could be my favorite manufacturer.

But mark my words: When Stern releases their Pokemon game, I will be writing so many praises here. I can feel it.

# Evening
Went for a walk to see how Annie was feeling. Ended up just buying a beer at the Co-Op and coming home.

Talked about the new pinball machine on the back porch.

Then I played Halo 2 on the Steam Deck until like 9 PM, when I made dinner and then stayed up until like 1 AM. Gotta stop doing that.
