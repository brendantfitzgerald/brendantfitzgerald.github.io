# Morning
Lazy morning. Bed and coffee from 8:30 until 10:30.
Caught up on my journaling and communications with that time though.

Bought tickets for *Join or Die* at FilmScene today.
Annie and I will be tabling for pinball at the club fair afterwards.

# Evening
*Join or Die* was good. I don't think it's a great introduction to Bowling Alone though. More of a love letter.
But it also has a direct call to action. Admittedly, the speakers took so long before the movie, I left at about 4:45 PM because 
the club fair started at 4:30. I don't know how much time was left, but I got the idea.

The club fair itself went OK. We were set up next to the pinball machine in the lobby, but most of the action was around the periphery of the Chauncey.
Still, we gave away all our brochures, all of our "free tournament entry" vouchers, and a lot of stickers.

It was nice to meet all the other clubs though. The Hawkeye Model Railroad Club was particularly interesting to both Annie and me.
Annie pointed out it was a very similar vibe to a pinball meetup.

We also had a great talk with [Patrick "Packy" Moran](https://sportmanagement.clas.uiowa.edu/people/packy-moran) of U Iowa's Sports Management program.
He was at the fair with [Pickleball Johnson County](https://www.pbjohnsoncountyia.org), but came over to talk to us about pinball as recreation, and 
how to place more machines, and get more students at tournaments. I'd love to pick his brain about how his program is handling eSports (and how 
that's applicable to pinball.) I'd be chuffed to try an actual pinball coaching/practice program, even if it means some 19 year-old telling me 
I can't drink beer until I break 500 million on Star Wars.

Came home and had ramen with fake chicken and fake hard-boiled egg, and watched the start of Red Letter Media's latest video.

# Thoughts
I'm curious about the decline of Social Capital in America as it relates to Real Estate prices.
The trend lines are inverse for Home Prices divided by Median Income and bowling leagues, but there's a lot of trends that correlate since the 1960s.
