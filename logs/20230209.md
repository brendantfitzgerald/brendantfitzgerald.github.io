## Work
Woke up feeling my best and brightest.  
Work was fine, the guys didn't wake up until probably 10 or so.  
Said goodbye to them around 11 AM, they're heading straight south to Dallas.  

## Home
Annie wasn't feeling well[^1], so I got to take care of her a bit.  
Dinner was roasted Brussels sprouts, Gardein fish sticks, and quinoa.  
We watched an Only Connect and then she went to bed.  
I did more dishes, put laundry in the dryer, and generally just tidied up.  

[^1] A lack of sleep, a whirlwind family visit, drinking too much, and then even more lack of sleep isn't great for your health.
