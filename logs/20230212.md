## Work
Had a duplicate credit line issue. No big deal, but caused a problem with the data.  
Got it resolved.  

## Walk
Annie and I walked down to Ulysses Modern to look for coffee tables.  
We stopped into the Euro Food store on the way. Mostly Eastern European stuff (Poland was the furthest West I saw). But still nice!  
Didn't find one we liked, but they had 50% off winter coats, so I got a Marlboro racing jacket for $40. Very windproof.  
Went to Big Grove afterwards and the weather was so nice that we sat outside by a firepit.  
We got fries, an Easy Eddy, and a Freezy Eddy (my favorite).  

## Home
Bopped around the house. Annie talked to her parents. We hung out for a bit.  
Too late to watch a movie, and then I had do some work stuff around 10 PM.
