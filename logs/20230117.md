Busy day at work with lots of little stuff. Still feel like we're recovering from Christmas/New Years.  
Didn't end up going to SpareMe after work. I still need to try using OBS at home. 
The question is getting the scores from the browser and a camera on the playfield at the same time.  
Watched more _Berserk_ and talked to Annie. She's having a rough time in Connecticut, it's been nonstop for her since Sunday.  
Went to The Vine with Anthony to play trivia. Leo hosted. Khyla, Harry, and Emma were also on our team. We won because Khyla 
has the order of the books of the bible memorized. (Although some controversy as to whether Romans counts as one book or two.)  
I also had some beers (Miller Lite), and a green tea shot that we got for winning.  
Definitely not dry January, but a good reminder that booze is a "sometimes" thing, and that I pay for it the next morning.  
Woke up in the middle of the night roasting because I'm not used to drinking, especially with a heated blanket.  
Gotta exercise.
