## Kansas City
Got up, coffee, Meshuggah Bagels, and hung out.  
It was around 50 degrees out, so I used chalk on the front steps to draw with the kids.  
Left around 1 PM, got back to Iowa City about 6, the cats were happy to have us home.  
It was nice to be back with Annie, we talked the whole ride home.  

## Iowa City
Had Bread Garden burritos for dinner, watched Red Letter Media's [Best of The Worst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4nAm93Dkls) 
and went to bed early.
