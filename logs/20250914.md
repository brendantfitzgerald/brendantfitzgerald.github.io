# Morning
Woke up at 9 AM. Had coffee. Annie and I talked about what would have happened if the US had invaded the Soviets after World War II.

As it turns out, [Operation Unthinkable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Unthinkable) has a lot of the answers.

Had a second cup of coffee on the couch. Bullied Annie into getting Procreate on her iPad. I had fun with the watercolor brushes.

# Evening
Went grocery shopping by way of Ace Hardware for a paint scraper and RoundUp (for tree of heaven), and Quinton's to adjust the pricing 
on Star Trek and check a game-ending bug. Something in the trough makes the game think the ball has drained, so it kills your flippers. 
Probably need a new opto.

Finally got to the Hy-Vee in North Liberty, got our car washed, and filled up the tank.

Came home, worked on disassembling the front steps more (still one more screw to go), talked to Baker briefly, then went out for a drink 
at Wilder's on the ped mall.

Got back home and fed the cats.

I called Baker back and we talked until like 12:30 AM again. Mostly about Catechism and stuff.

Slept like a rock.

# Thoughts
I need to establish some goals and soon. I've had ill-defined, nebulous goals all Summer, and of course, didn't get any of them done.

These will be divided into [Goals and Habits](https://github.com/brendantfitzgerald/brendantfitzgerald.github.io/blob/main/logs/2025GoalsHabits),
and I'll need to update them as time goes on.
