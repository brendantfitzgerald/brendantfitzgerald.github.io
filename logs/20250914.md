# Morning
Woke up at 9 AM. Had coffee. Annie and I talked about what would have happened if the US had invaded the Soviets after World War II.

As it turns out, [Operation Unthinkable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Unthinkable) has a lot of the answers.

Had a second cup of coffee on the couch. Bullied Annie into getting Procreate on her iPad. I had fun with the watercolor brushes.

# Evening

# Thoughts
I need to establish some goals and soon. I've had ill-defined, nebulous goals all Summer, and of course, didn't get any of them done.

These will be divided into [Goals and Habits](https://github.com/brendantfitzgerald/brendantfitzgerald.github.io/blob/main/logs/2025GoalsHabits),
and I'll need to update them as time goes on.
