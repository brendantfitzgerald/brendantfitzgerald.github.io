Ate a bunch before I couldn't.  
Watched YouTube and junk to relax before getting my teeth out.  
Left around 1 PM and tried to drop off my tickets for The Thing at the FilmScene box office, but it didn't open until 3.

What an experience! So glad I went for local anesthetic.  
My right wisdom tooth was exposed, but my left was still covered.  
After the anesthetic set in, the right tooth came out in under a minute. Amazing.  
Lefty required a lot more work. Cutting and grabbing and pushing and pulling. (I'm sure I saw a tooth shard fly out of my mouth.)  
But I got to keep my teeth! They're in a little baggie. I'm thrilled.  
On further review, lefty's definitely missing some bits.  
I hope I never have to have a surgery ever again.

Watched YouTube. Tidied up the house a bit.  
Ate pudding, a quart of carrot soup, and one slice of cheese (slowly).  
Went to bed at 10 and slept solidly.  
I slept on my side, so Lucy was under my butt all night. Testament to me not tossing and turning.
