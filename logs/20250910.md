# Morning
Whirlwind!

Didn't stop working basically all day.

Charlie Kirk was shot and killed in the afternoon. At least one friend said "fafo bigots". I don't think much of that friend's opinions.

It's been weird trying to put into words the difference between this assassination, the killing (assassination?) of the United Healthcare Insurance CEO, 
and the attempted assassination(s) of Trump. Best I can do is that the latter two victims were directly in charge of the people committing, 
or about to commit, violence (from the killer's perspective). Charlie Kirk talked. Probably threw money around too, and advised Trump in an 
unofficial capacity, but he was killed for espousing his beliefs, not his direct actions.

But all of this probably why political violence is taboo. Don't have to deal in grey areas of morality if you avoid the action altogether.

# Evening
## Termites
Annie and I saw some strange bugs flying out from our stoop as we were sitting outside after work. I'd never seen anything like them.

That's because they're termites.

So. The front porch steps are coming down ASAP because that's where the wet, rotting wood is.

God damn it.

## Hawkeye Model Railroad Club
Went to the Hawkeye Model Railroad Club's meeting at 7 PM. Got a tour and talked trains for 2 hours. It was a lot, but super nice.

The moon was low and almost red when we left at 9 PM.

Annie's excited about the modeling, I'm excited about the electronics.

But something isn't sitting right with me. I don't think I can commit to the club as they want me to.

There's already pinball, and pottery, and the house, and the houseplants, and the cats, and the possibility of kids, and work,
and frankly, none of them are getting the attention they deserve! (Clearly! God damn termites!)

So I think I'll let Annie do the Model Railroad Club for now. I wouldn't mind setting up an N Scale set at home, but I want to do the 
DC Metro and SEPTA and some Amtrak.

I'm glad to write out what I'm feeling. I'd love to join the club, but it wouldn't be fair to either of us.

## Pinball Podcast
Listened to *The Pinball Show* for the first time in probably over a year. They're still annoying, but I guess The Pinball Network is no more.

The only thing of value that I learned is that Stern's next cornerstone game is rumored to be Pokemon. That might tempt me to buy new-in-box again.

## *Reamde*
Didn't go to bed until late, but started reading Neal Stephenson's *Reamde*. I guess for all my complaining, I like the guy's writing.
