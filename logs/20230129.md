Woke up at 7. Read, played Vampire Survivors, and browsed the internet until Annie woke up.  
Had coffee, Annie and I hung out, ate bagels, considered going to the grocery store, 
but realized we didn't need anything, and kept hanging out in bed instead.  
When we finally got up, we reorganized the kitchen, then went to Jo-Ann Fabrics.  

## SpareMe
Went to SpareMe to play pinball and ran into Anthony.  
He got the job at the CDC! Totally remote, so he's moving to Connecticut at the end of February to be with Andrea.  
We drank too much to celebrate.  
Also Adam is enjoying his Ratpack, he watched _You've Got Mail_.

Came home, Annie had the bright idea to eat tater tots. Very good idea.  
She went to bed, and I stayed up, had another beer, and listened to music. Bad idea.  
I did manage to read a bit when I finally went up to bed.
