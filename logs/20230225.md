Woke up with Marty at sunrise.  
Doofed around online until Annie woke up.  
She went to the studio, and I continued goofing around with ChatGPT until 3 when I went to meet her.  
We went to SpareMe, allegedly just to play pinball, but left hours later after drinks.  
Got some popcorn tofu from the co-op on the way home.  
Watched an Only Connect, and then started the latest Best of The Worst before I called it.
