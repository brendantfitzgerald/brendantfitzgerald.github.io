Morning Meeting. We'll start reviewing action items next week.

# Evening
Called my Dad on the way to pinball night. He and Joy broke up.

I put up 1.2 Billion on Star Wars. 4th for the month, but didn't even make the board for the year.

Met David's parents and his daughter, talked to him and Pat for a while about bikes, then talked to a fella named Brandt who I've seen around.

Talked to Baker on the way home and until like 12:30 AM.
