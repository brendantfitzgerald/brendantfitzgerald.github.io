## Work
Finally getting somewhere with our reticent, distracted vendor. Took too long though.  
Going on goose chases trying to "save money" by doing a half-assed homebrew solution instead of just waiting to buy the real thing in 2024.  

## Home
Hung out with Annie, lazed around until like 7:15, then Annie made green beans, rice, and porkless bites for dinner.  
We left for the Chauncey at about 9.  

## Chauncey
Stopped by SpareMe to play pinball.  
Avery gave us some helpful gossip, and really maintained the machines. Friction approached zero as did the level.  
Also, dry January's over for him, and he's trying to find a happy medium, but leaning towards abstinence.  
Annie got a personal best on Star Trek.  
We headed over to FilmScene at 10 PM to see _Obstacle Corpse_ with Leo and Khyla at Late Shift.  
Everybody but me won a prize, so now I owe Leo a Ratpack.  
The movie was very fun. Got to talk to the director & producer couple afterwards. They're from Columbus, Ohio.  
Walked home and fell asleep by 2 AM.
