## North Dodge
Went out early to get Annie a soy mocha from Press and flowers from Hy-Vee for Valentine's Day.  

## Work
I miss the feeling of getting stuff done quickly.  
Roles don't matter so much on small teams. "Can you do it? OK, do it."  
To have a solid structure, you need to cement your foundation. Meaning you have to define boundaries.  
There's nothing wrong with having tents. You can arrange them quickly, but they don't offer much protection.  
Having a castle when you need a bunch of tents is much harder.  

Got to yell out the office window at a guy who was looking in car windows.  
Followed him while I called the cops. Which I only did in case he'd broken into other cars before I saw him.  
Working from home has definitely made my community safer at least.  

## Home
We were so sleepy.  
Ate dinner at 7:30, watched Only Connect, and eventually played [Tetris Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_Attack) on the _Super Annie Advance_.[^1]
