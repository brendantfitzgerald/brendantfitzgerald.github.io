## Work
Met another guy from Delaware! He works for nCino. He's from Bear though, so unlikely that we know anyone in common.  
Maybe Jeff Sullivan. That guy got around.  

## Home(ish)
Left for Hy-Vee immediately after work to pick up stuff before Katie and Bobby's visit this weekend.  
Shopped, got back, put away food, then immediately left for SpareMe.  
Hung out at SpareMe way late, drank too much, because we were talking with 
an [Incogmeato](https://web.archive.org/web/20230202163009/https://www.kelloggs.com/en_US/brands/incogmeato-consumer-brand.html) rep.  
I played some decent Deadpool though, before the beer kicked in. Annie got a personal best.  
Got home, Annie talked to Tom for an hour or so while we ate, and I had the brilliant idea to make an Iowa City Ice Water[^1]
Fell fast asleep at midnight.

## AI
Talked to the IT Chat about AI ethics. The Bing/ChatGPT LLM is giving responses that I think make it imperative 
that society agrees on what makes something worthy of moral consideration. 

And it has to be societal. I sent the following to the IT Chat:
> We can all be nice on an individual basis.  
> Even prior to going vegan, I never ate an animal that I'd met.  
> I'm sure plenty of people were "friendly" to people of color in America before 1965.  
> But there was/is still systemic injustice.  
> We either need to change our standard of sentience (dangerous as it will most likely elevate computers and dehumanize people) or 
> admit that these things appear to think and provide them a place in society accordingly. Self-determination, compensation, etc.  

> Of course, these things aren't human, and if we were rational, we'd probably agree not to create any more.  
> What do you do with an immortal autistic (in the original sense of the word) being?
