## Work
Lots of little issues popped up.  
A very confusing misunderstanding about Bills vs. Statements occurred in the morning, and went into the evening. Finally had to step in and write out an explanation.  
Good communication takes a lot of time. You have to be clear about what you want to say. Lots of writing then rewriting, reorganizing, and removing.  
Waiting on a call back about a Statement of Work for a massive import to our document storage system.  

Annie and I talked about Pruitt-Igoe in St. Louis, Columbia, Maryland, and Riverside Plaza in Minneapolis, as well as planned communities overall.  
Precipitated by my crazy idea to require new commercial/industrial construction to have X residential units within walking distance.

## Home
Cleaning service came today during work. Did a great job.  
After work, sat around.  
Annie had Art Office at 6, so I cooked dinner. Artichoke, onion, and Tofurky Chicken quesadillas.  
I watched the first episode of the _Sailor Moon_ redub by Viz.  
Annie came down, finished her food, and we did crossword puzzles until 9:30 PM.  
Read before bed, but had a hard time falling asleep. I'm beginning to suspect caffeine or lack of exercise is the culprit.
