## Work
Busy morning, but went to Sushiya in North Liberty for a team lunch, and cut out a little after 3 PM.  
Employee appreciation.  

## Downtown
Went to Wild Culture to refill our growler.  
Talked to Kyle for a while and had a shandy each.  
Went to Merge on the Ped Mall for the [2023 Spring Gallery Walk](https://web.archive.org/web/20230304141119/https://downtowniowacity.com/events/gallery-walk/). 
Steve Schuette[^1] was selling there. Beautiful stuff, and really reasonably priced.  
Also talked to abstract painter [Jay Provorse](https://web.archive.org/web/20230304141403/https://www.charlescitypress.com/front/2021/07/05/abstract-painter-provorse-featured-at-ccac/). 
In the past, I haven't liked art where you "see the motion", but his pieces are more like a puzzle. Trying to figure out when paint was added, removed, or 
rearranged draws you in.  
Got home by 7 PM.

## Home
I spent about 5 hours talking to Smuz and Baker. Had 3 beers in that time. Meaning what I thought was tipsy was most likely sleepy. I love getting old.  
Of course the topic turned back to people we knew in college. It's funny how many people we can only find via a wedding registry.
