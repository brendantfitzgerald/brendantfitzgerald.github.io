# Morning
Slow start again. Annie's working off-site this morning. Being alone is nice. I think my social battery might be dangerously low. 
There's more to it, I'm sure, but being around people is a vicious cycle of cause and effect.

It's been unseasonably cold after weeks of sustained heat. Tough to sleep with the windows open.
Last night, some poor college kid was yelling "F**k" a lot outside. Sounded like a gal may have cheated on him.
Forgot that was a trope of the first few weeks of college.

Looking at how to get into corporate librarianship consulting. Most places probably don't need a full-time librarian. But they could 
spend a few thousand bucks and get a consultant to implement their information organization system.

# Evening
Went to SpareMe around 7 to fix Foo Fighters up before it goes to a private rental. 
Replaced the coild sleeves on all the flippers, filed down the ends of the shafts, and replaced the rubbers.
We also installed more plastic protectors for the slingshots and the Overlord plastics.
And the most impactful piece: adjusted the guide from the ball launch that sends the ball up the left ramp instead of into the UFO captive ball. That makes the launch a real treat because it starts the game with a tour of the playfield.

It was nice to just work on a machine with Annie. 
Take our time and think things through rather than get a lot of opinions and/or play host.
