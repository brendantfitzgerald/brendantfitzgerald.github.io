# Morning
Slow start again. Annie's working off-site this morning. Being alone is nice. I think my social battery might be dangerously low. 
There's more to it, I'm sure, but being around people is a vicious cycle of cause and effect.

It's been unseasonably cold after weeks of sustained heat. Tough to sleep with the windows open.
Last night, some poor college kid was yelling "F**k" a lot outside. Sounded like a gal may have cheated on him.
Forgot that was a trope of the first few weeks of college.

Looking at how to get into corporate librarianship consulting. Most places probably don't need a full-time librarian. But they could 
spend a few thousand bucks and get a consultant to implement their information organization system.
