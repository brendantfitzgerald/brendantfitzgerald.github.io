Anthony came over to the house for one last hang before he leaves for Connecticut.  
I still remember the first time we met Andrea, then the first time meeting him.  
There were two lights in the Western sky tonight. Almost perfectly horizontal from each other and bright. Shining through cloud cover bright.  
It was Jupiter and Europa, but what a spooky look for some reason. Probably all of the spy balloon stories lately.  
Anthony gave us a 3' wide "Anisetta Evangelisti" poster that they had in their kitchen.  
We're going to put it next to the bar in the dining room. In the opposite corner from the _King Kong_ poster. Sensing a theme?
