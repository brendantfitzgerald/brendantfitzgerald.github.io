## Kansas City
Work was long and slow.  
Good news on the family front though, so good mood all around.  
Got done work, ordered Waldo's pizza, and had some beers to celebrate.  
Played with the kids, tried out a new security camera set up, and ate pizza.  
After the kids went to bed, we played [Secret Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Hitler), and then went to bed ourselves.
