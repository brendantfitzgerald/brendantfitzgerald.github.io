Worked all day.  
Took lunch at 4 PM to go meet Annie at LIAL where she was finishing up some cataloging.  
Called Baker on the walk there.
Picked up Annie's necklace from Hands Jewelers. They weren't able to resize it because it's steel (weird.)  
Got drinks with Annie at The Greenhouse afterwards. It was almost 60 degrees out, and the bartender was nice enough to let us bring chairs outside.  
Had taquitos for dinner and watched Only Connect.  
Went to bed early and read [The Big Sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Sleep) until 10:30.
