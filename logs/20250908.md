# Morning
No calls scheduled at work, so got to do heads-down work and worry that I should be doing something else.

I miss having a work management system like I did in IT. If I ever get to be in charge, that's what I'm implementing. Whether it's Microsoft Outlook Tasks 
or Cases in Salesforce or whatever! One system for communication (email) and one system for requesting work.

Still, got a lot done.

# Evening

Tried some new exercises with Annie. See how we feel tomorrow.

Hung out in bed with the mattress pad turned on high heat afterwards. Like a little dry hot tub.

Ate Goodles macaroni and cheese with tofurkey chicken and broccoli while we watched *Escape from L.A.*.

## *Escape from L.A.*

What a terrible, terrible movie. I normally like borderline movies. Hypothesizing how they could be fixed is a fun exercise. 

You can not fix *Escape from L.A.*. The visuals are bad. The story is bad. The characters are bad. The music is bad. 
The acting is fine, I guess, but all in the service of bad.

How a 90 minute movie drags is beyond me, but my goodness.

## Called Baker

Talked to Baker after weeks of phone tag. Usual fare -- catching up, goofs about current affairs, etc. But he mentioned he's been 
thinking about Iowa City more. I think everyone should live here, but especially my friends and family.

I'm going to pitch him bringing Rachel here for a week. Get an AirBnB, remote work, act like you live here. If he waits much longer, 
he might get a crash course in Iowa cold though.

### An Example Iowa City Itinerary
