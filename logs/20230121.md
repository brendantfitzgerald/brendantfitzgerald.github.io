Didn't do much.  
Goofed around the house. Finally did dishes, showered, etc.  
Watched Youtube. Went to Double Tap to see the new pinball machines.  

## Double Tap
Played The Mandalorian, Led Zeppelin, and Legends of Valhalla (from American Pinball).  
The first two are fine. Valhalla is a different story. Beautiful table, but can't catch the ball, so my shots are trash.  
They got rid of Stranger Things, Deadpool, and The Beatles. Bad trades, but at least SpareMe's got 2/3 covered.  
Updated Pinball Map with the new lineup.

More goofing around. Can't tell you anything that I did, productive or otherwise.  
Watched [_Repo Man_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repo_Man_(film)) before bed. I can't belive it took me this long to watch it.
