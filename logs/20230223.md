## Work
Feeling better, but still a little disconnected.  
Took Annie to QuickCare in Old Capitol at 9, I brought my laptop and was able to work, and we were back by 10.  
Really highlighting the benefit of Work-from-Home for all parties.  
They got me to keep working, I got to take care of Annie.  
Had a departmental meeting in the afternoon.  
The department's so big that more than 2 sentences about a project that doesn't immediately affect me is wasted.  

## Home
Picked up Annie's prescription from Hy-Vee, along with some other stuff.  
Came back, called Baker and drank beer. Forgot to eat.  
Borrowed [_Beyond Lies the Wub_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Lies_the_Wub) by Philip K. Dick at Baker's suggestion.  
Can only read it on my phone though.  
Went to sleep.
