Lazy morning.  
Showered and had the idea for [Multiverse-AdminTools.md](https://github.com/brendantfitzgerald/brendantfitzgerald.github.io/blob/main/Multiverse-AdminTools.md).  
Wrote it afterwards.  
Finished all the crosswords in the house and Annie gave me a massage.  
Dry January experiment started at 3 PM.  
Annie made tomato bisque from Purple Carrot for dinner and we watched _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ Episodes 2 through 4.[^1]  

Annie some "break and bake" cookies from the co-op. They were vegan, free from gluten and everything else, so their consistency was odd, but the taste was good.  
We got them because they were on sale, but I couldn't stop thinking about how they're a perfect example of a flaw in modern capitalism.  
People want to make cookies. But they don't have the time or energy to make cookies because they have to work (and commute), so here's a product that you can buy 
that just barely qualifies as "making cookies".  
That's cynical, I know, but people are pressured into being hyper-specialized and generalists at the same time, and so we get subpar cookies on all fronts.  
If we could agree that home-made cookies from scratch are delicious because of their labor and that bakery-made cookies are delicious for their ingredients, 
then maybe we could also agree that home-made cookies without the labor and bakery-made cookies without carefully chosen ingredients make the cookie not worth eating.  

Annie went to bed around 10 PM. I hung out with Marty the cat and goofed around online until midnight.  
Read _The Dispossessed_ until I fell asleep. Interesting sleep. Seemed like I was either 100% asleep or awake, but woke up rested.  



[^1]: Biggest takeaways: The uniforms made everyone's butt look sad, especially Riker, and Armin Shimerman was Ferengi from their first appearance!
