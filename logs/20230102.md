Finished reading *The Big Sleep* this morning, and started [*A Prayer for the Crown-Shy*](https://www.goodreads.com/sv/book/show/40864030-a-prayer-for-the-crown-shy).  
Cut my hair and went to the mall with Annie.  
Cooked pesto flatbread from Purple Carrot and watched an Only Connect while we ate.  
Added my scores from New Year's Eve to Pindigo (those worth adding).  
Listened to [Radio-Activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-Activity) by Kraftwerk.  
Researched [Whisper from OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/whisper). It requires at least 1 GB of VRAM though, so no luck on any machine I own.  
Finished *A Prayer for the Crown-Shy.*
Slept poorly.
