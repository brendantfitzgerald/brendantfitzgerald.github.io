Lazy morning from a late night.  
Walked to the Co-Op, got burritos and some other groceries and a copy of the Gazette.  
Came home, put things away, and almost immediately went back out to The Prairie Kitchen Store on the Northside.  
Bought some reusable bamboo cutlery to replace my lost set. Bought bamboo cutlery instead of metal specifically for if it were lost or got too gross. 
It will degrade or be burnable.  
Came back, went through a bin of nostalgic crap from my parents while Annie cooked.  

It struck me that the last time I saw my mom, she dropped off all this stuff, then left the country.  
I understand dropping off my own stuff, but to give away all the memorabilia from our family's life together makes it a little more clear that it's over.  
Why should I treasure it if no one else does?  
Eh.  

Watched an episode of _Severance_, and then went to bed early to do a crossword puzzle.  
Read _Spook Country_ until I fell asleep.
