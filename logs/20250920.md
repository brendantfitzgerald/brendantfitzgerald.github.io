# Morning
Relaxing morning. Coffee, etc.

Exercised with Annie, showered, e-mailed Phoebe Martin about taking another look at 528 S. Lucas St (now under contract, boo), 
e-mailed someone who reached out to us about Sea Wolf pinball last year (one finally came up for sale), 
and wrote some Reddit comments, including a guide to getting involved in Iowa City.

# Evening
We met Alex at Northside Oktoberfest, which was fun, but seemed to have a *much* lower turnout than expected.
But Alex met Connor and Molly of Kindred Coffee, which was nice. Also, we got *so much* food from them. 
We'll figure out how to pay them back. Probably with pottery and food.

At 7:30, we went to Mickey's improv show. We were supposed to bring Jim, but he had a cold.

Afterwards, Mickey came over for a couple of beers and debrief.

Then we ate dinner, Annie went to bed, but I watched the old *Muppet Show* episode with Jean Stapleton, and the George Bush episode of *The Simpsons*.

I called Baker after that, and we talked until almost 2 AM.
