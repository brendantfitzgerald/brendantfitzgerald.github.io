## Work
Woke up paying for the previous night's excess.  
Had some conversations about Live weekend. It's fast approaching, and I'm hoping we'll spend a little more to bring some resources on-site.  
Made spaghetti for lunch. Tried to cook it in a pan. Why? Because the instructions used the word "pan" instead of "pot. Didn't work out great.  

## Home
Showered while Annie sewed before we headed out for a date.  
Texted Chris Troyer about the Pinball Tournament.  

## Double Tap
Black Rose, Houdini, and Valhalla were all out of order.  
We played Led Zeppelin and Mandalorian.  
I think we were still out of sorts, because neither of us did very well.  
Ran into Ethan and Stacy Ann (sp?), and told them about the Pinball Tournament.  

## Bread Garden / New Pioneer Co-op
Got burritos at Bread Garden.  
It was so cold (under 5 degrees) that we walked through the Library and the Chauncey to get to the Co-op.  
Got tempeh and 2 cases (48 cans) of La Croix because they were on sale.  

## Home
Ate burritos, watched the first episode of _Remington Steele_ and went to bed early.  
Read _The Dispossessed_ until I fell asleep.
