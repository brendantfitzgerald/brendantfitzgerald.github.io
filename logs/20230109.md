At work. Researching SilverLake security.  
At work. New, more complicated change management procedure for the whole org. Skepticism abound.  
After work, downloaded all of the _Art•I•Fact_ podcast by Matt Morrissette and Dan Richmond, friends from 1984 arcade bar in Wilmington, DE.

## Ped Mall
Annie and I went to Double Tap on the Ped Mall. I drank Budweiser Zero. (dry January yay).  
Annie doubled her personal best on The Beatles, and I beat my personal best on Deadpool and Houdini[^1].  
Saw Ethan and Stacy Ann there too. Nice to catch up with them.  
We got burritos from Bread Garden and the first two discs of _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ Season 1 from the Library on the way home.

Watched the quarter-final episode of _The Great Pottery Throwdown_ series 5 as we ate. I didn't expect to like abstract self-sculpture, but I did.  
Read before bed.  
Had a fitful night's sleep. Probably because I mistakenly made 3 cups of caffeinated coffee instead of 2 regular, 1 decaf like usual.  

[^1]: Only 15,000 away from the median score for Houdini on Pindigo.
