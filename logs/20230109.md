If yesterday was lazy, today was decadent.  
Had coffee, ate breakfast, read and talked in bed until 11 AM.  
Rode 9 miles on the bike in 30 minutes. (Watched a [video about Japan-exclusive Zelda games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gqZkzbY0cY).)  
Showered.  
Hung out with Annie.  
Goofed around on my own for a while.  
Went to L&M Shop and called my dad on the way.  
Hung out with Annie some more.  
Watched some videos on how to be good at Super Smash Bros. Melee, then tried out what I'd learned. Didn't go well. (I blame the 22 year-old controller.)  
Read before bed.
