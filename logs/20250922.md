Work.

Fixed Halloween pinball at FilmScene (the coinbox was jammed up against the coin mechs, which made the machine freak out).

Then we went to the pottery studio, but the place was in disarray and we didn't have our names on the shelves.

Regardless, we had a bunch of stuff to glaze, so we did.

We went to SpareMe afterwards and had a debrief with beer. It was nice. Ended up talking to Alison basically the whole time, but 
we also met Owen and Charlotte, who are new employees.

Came back home, had dinner, then exercised on the front porch during a storm where the lightning and thunder never stopped.
