# Catch Up
## Expo
Went to the Pinball Expo in Schaumburg back in October for 3 days. It was too much and seemed to be mostly for the home audience.
Even the operator-focused items were for larger operators. Might buy some claw machines and join the AMOA though.

## Rental Property
Found a reasonably priced rental property at 320 N. Dodge St. Walked by it, toured it, met with our mortgage lender, could put in an offer soon.
Just need to pick between a 5-Year ARM and a 30-Year Fixed Rate. With the rates being what they are, the 30-Year ends up being better, but is a lot more down.
This is the first time in my life I have to make financing decisions outside of a Zero Interest Rate Policy world. Things make more sense, but feel weird.

## Work
They're hiring a new IT Administrator for Commercial. I'd love to know why they think people are leaving the IT Department and how doing 
more of the same will stem that attrition. They should be regrouping system responsibilities by function 
(Core goes with Core, Origination goes with Origination, etc.) But they haven't and seemingly won't.

Good news is that Tall Nate applied for the position, and I think there's a good chance he'll be offered the role. It'd mean we'd be back to working 
together every day. Just took 8 or 9 years to get back to. As for getting the rest of the guys back together, we'd probably never be able to pay Joe enough, 
and James would *hate* the culture (the stupid parts at least), but maybe Philly Nate could hack it. Might get bored though.

## Dad
Dad's engaged to a woman I've never met. She sounds fine, but heck, they only met a year or two ago. I don't know what the rush is.
I'm not upset that I haven't met her (nor was I invited out to), just disappointed because I think it would be better for both of them 
if they were the kind of people to wait until my sister and I had met this woman before formalizing things.

They're planning on a Spring wedding too. Which doesn't leave much time to inventory the lives they've been living separately and 
figure out how to combine them.

Oh well, par for the course.

## Mom
At some point, my Mom sent some message about coming to see me.

I only saw that in the preview and haven't responded.

I also haven't read any physical cards from her or the Kimmels.

It's not a strong stance, it's just that I "want to wait until I'm in the right headspace". Never happens and then all of a sudden it's been months.

What I need to offer at some point is to meet in some neutral city. Although I don't want to do even that.

But the last time I tried to have an honest conversation about my feelings with her, it wasn't received well. I haven't reread it in years, but 
I think maybe leading with "This isn't an attack" might prime some people to feel attacked.

But also, if either of my parents were exercising their "constructively talk about feelings" muscles for the past few decades, things probably 
would have gone more smoothly.

Oh well, par for the course.
