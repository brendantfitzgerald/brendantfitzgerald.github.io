# Morning
Work as usual. Lots of meetings, but I'm waiting for my "get it done (and documented)" policy to come the a head.

# Evening
Went to Target and then the Green House for a drink.

Exercised together, then lazed around for an hour.

Pizza for dinner and then played Balatro.

# Thoughts
Was listening to the Monocle Daily. They talked about France's inability to keep a prime minister.
But also, the French protestors feel that their taxes shouldn't increase, but corporate taxes should.

Allegedly that's untenable, but I haven't looked into specifics.

Still, I got thinking about how governments can respond to a lack of consensus.

## Reduce centralized power. 
If groups A and B can't agree on how to do X, let them both do X.
On average, I think this will reduce quality of life in the country because almost everything benefits from scale.
But I think it will also re-introduce the experiment of democracy. Multiple ways to try living. 
Test Minnesota's theories of governance against Alabama's. See what wins.

This requires that most people are able to vote with their feet, wallets, and ballots. 

## Greatly increase centralized power. (What we're doing.)
One way to do things! If you don't like it, too bad. At least until 4-8 years later when the other side gets a go. 
And corrupt the good and noble expansion of power that we created. Everyone complains half the time. Complaints get worse over time.

Not sure where this ends.
