# Morning
Woke up later than I'd like again. Still got to work on-time and everything, but I'm looking forward to early nights.

## Getting it done.

Started my "get it done" movement today. Not only did our change process change without warning (just ironic or more telling?) 
and push a bunch of my projects ~2 months out, I just found out that I don't have any project resources from IT for the 
month of September because of their annual hackathon, the Salesforce conference, and a huge project's go-live.

So, I'm doing what I can without them, which as it turns out is a lot. If you knew me, you'd know how much it pains me to not follow an established process.
I want to use the established process until it breaks *and then fix it*. But you can't take an established process and change it with no notice.

I'm documenting the what, why, and how. I'm just not going through the: 
* 4 week approval process 
* 6 week IT intake process 
* 2 2-week Sprints for development (minimum)

If you're playing along at home, that's like 2.5 months for any project that's over 5 hours of (inflated) work or touches multiple systems. 
Because scrum doesn't work for admins, and they're incentivized (or not punished) for over-estimating projects, and they *have to* build in 
a buffer because who knows when an 8 hour problem will crop up randomly?

Between that and Changes to our Change Management process not going through the Change Management process themselves, I don't know what 
everyone's goals are, and I'm starting to think they don't know either.

# Evening
Spent about 40 minutes after work responding to a comment on an Idea I submitted to partner Help Desk staff with Administrators to provide familiarity 
with the admins' systems. I haven't had a good idea misunderstood or dismissed like that in some time. It'll be fine. We'll just get more of the same.

No obligations tonight. So tired though.

Got Bread Garden burritos, but they used factory-made tortillas instead of their usual hand-pressed, and the result was bad. 
So bad that Annie emailed Bread Garden to ask if this was their plan moving forward. 
Ironic because I finally signed up for their rewards program tonight.

Watched the first episode of *Alien Earth*. Not sure if we'll keep it up. It's intriguing, but I was hoping for more *Battlestar Galactica* or 
*The Expanse*. This was more cinematic and action-focused. Still, I'll watch another episode.

I took a bath thinking that would get me to sleep earlier. Maybe technically, but I was in there from like 9:30 to 11 PM.
Watched a lot of clips from various Muppets shows. It's so well insulated, the water never got cold, just cooler.

# Thoughts

Something's definitely up. This tiredness is coloring all of my interactions and thoughts.
