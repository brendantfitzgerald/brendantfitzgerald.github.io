# Morning
Woke up later than I'd like again. Still got to work on-time and everything, but I'm looking forward to early nights.

## Getting it done.

Started my "get it done" movement today. Not only did our change process change without warning (just ironic or more telling?) 
and push a bunch of my projects ~2 months out, I just found out that I don't have any project resources from IT for the 
month of September because of their annual hackathon, the Salesforce conference, and a huge project's go-live.

So, I'm doing what I can without them, which as it turns out is a lot. If you knew me, you'd know how much it pains me to not follow an established process.
I want to use the established process until it breaks *and then fix it*. But you can't take an established process and change it with no notice.

I'm documenting the what, why, and how. I'm just not going through the: 
* 4 week approval process 
* 6 week IT intake process 
* 2 2-week Sprints for development (minimum)

If you're playing along at home, that's like 2.5 months for any project that's over 5 hours of (inflated) work or touches multiple systems. 
Because scrum doesn't work for admins, and they're incentivized (or not punished) for over-estimating projects, and they *have to* build in 
a buffer because who knows when an 8 hour problem will crop up randomly?

Between that and Changes to our Change Management process not going through the Change Management process themselves, I don't know what 
everyone's goals are, and I'm starting to think they don't know either.
