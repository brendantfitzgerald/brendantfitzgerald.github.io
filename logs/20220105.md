Worked all day.  
Shoveled sidewalk over lunch.  
Walked to the co-op with Annie after work for coffee as a gift for Adam and Carla (Stormcat from Wake Up Iowa)  
Cooked dinner (mushroom bulgur soup from Purple Carrot) and talked to Baker.  
Watched _Great Pottery Throwdown_.  
Went to bed early and read _The Dispossessed_.

Had a violent nightmare in the middle of the night and woke up hyper-vigilant for about 5 minutes.  
Luckily, I was neither perpetrator nor victim in the nightmare, just a witness.  
It started out with Michael Myers from _Halloween_ in his car, which then became a weird knockoff version of _The Hitcher_, and ended with Vladimir Putin slowly twisting a cop's head in half in front of me.  
Just remembered another dream afterwards where my dad and I were playing some arcade game at a movie theater, and I was complaining about crypto.
