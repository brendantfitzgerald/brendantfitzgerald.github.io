# Morning
Went to the Farmer's Market, shared a vegan almond croissant from Valerie's and bought 2 freezer boxes of habaneros from the tomato/pepper stand.

Came home and finally finished taking off the first step of the front porch stairs. The frame is rotting all over the place.

So, I sent some photos to my dad, who claimed it was going to be easy to rebuild. That may be, but with the historic preservation BS and the fact 
that I'd have to help, I elected to email Martin Construction and Sueppels for quotes. 

I'm super allergic to sawdust and whatever mold grows in wet pulp. Break out in hives immediately, start wheezing quickly after. It's 
one of the most embarrassing things about myself. Other embarrassing things I can write off as unimportant or maybe character-building, but 
there is no upshot to being allergic to wood.

I told Annie I'd do the allergy panel and get shots for whatever they find. Quality of life and all that.

# Evening
Dropped off newspapers and a 2-foot 1.25" wooden dowel at the pottery studio.

Then went to SpareMe to fix an alleged issue with Venom where it would load 2 balls, although I didn't see it happen.

No one else was there and then a *bunch* of families came in, so we left pretty quick.

Came home, watched Rifftrax's *Roadhouse*, and had a Daiya pizza.
