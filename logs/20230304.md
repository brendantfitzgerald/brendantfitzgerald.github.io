Woke up early, despite staying up late with the boys.  
Doofed around until Annie got up.  
We talked about video games and why mass media seems to lose its appeal. Put shortly:
> Been thinking about the place of video games in the sphere of mass media.
Itâ€™s an activity, unlike movies/books/etc, which makes for a shared, but personal, experience.
However, like the rest of mass media, you have to stay on the edge to participate in the sharing. The excitement is the unknown. 
I think shareable personal experiences might be the goal for any surrogate activity. And those almost have to be limited to a point in time or space.

I started in on sorting the boxes in the basement.  
Annie left for the studio around 5.
Met Annie at the studio at about 7:15 to sand some pieces, but again, they really don't need much anymore.  
Went to SpareMe around 8.  
Mad busy because of some call-outs.  
I got a personal best on Star Trek.  
Annie was more tired/hungry than me, so she left around 10:30.  
I stayed until close, because of course I did.  

Walked home, ate half a quesadilla and some chicken nuggets that Annie left for me, and went straight to bed.
