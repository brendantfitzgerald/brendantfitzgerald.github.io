# Morning
Moved the pinball machines!

Annie got us coffee and burritos while I got the U-Haul.
* Moved Foo Fighters to Ben's.
* Moved Star Wars Home Pin to Axiom.
* Moved Halloween to FilmScene.
* Moved Jaws to SpareMe.

Had vegan pizza and beer at SpareMe to celebrate a successful move.

# Evening
Helped Alex and Kate move a Rodgers Jamestown 100 II organ from a U-Haul into their living room.
It sounded great! And then either one or two diodes blew on the power supply.

We got Trumpet Blossom delivered and drank some beer around a fire

Then their dogs found a rabbit nest. They got one little bunny, bad enough that Alex had to put it down.
But the silver lining to that very dark cloud is that because we stopped them when Annie noticed the squeaking didn't sound like a toy,
Alex and Kate were able to (surprisingly quickly) build a two-part barrier that rabbits could get in and out of, but the dogs couldn't.
Otherwise, the dogs probably would have been in the yard alone and gotten through all of the bunnies.

I guess I'm still an indoor cat guy.

Took a bath and was in bed by 9:45 PM, but didnt fall asleep until after 11.
Still reading *Seveneves*, and I think it may be my least favorite Stephenson book to date.
