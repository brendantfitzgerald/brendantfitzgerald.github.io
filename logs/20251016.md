Drove to Schaumburg for Pinball Expo.
Talked a lot about how to resolve cultural conflict in civil society. Decided it would require acknowledging differences 
which would require recognizing that differences exist, that they are generalizations, and that they are morally equal, generally, while being better suited 
to some situations. Tricky stuff, if it's even the right idea.

Pinball Expo is a lot. We had just checked in (behind Jersey Jack himself) when an excited man interrupted conversations we were having. Twice. 
We were warned off of entering the Main Tournament because it was so over-attended that we wouldn't finish our qualifying. It ended up going until 1 AM.

But we did enter the Classics. And talk to Chris Turner of Turner Pinball. We complimented all of their innovation, and commiserated a little bit over 
the pinball community's lack of interest in breaking from tradition (different body styles, removing the backbox, etc.) Super nice guy.

Saw Harry, Heather, Caleb Mann, Michelle and Cody from the Quad Cities, the Haakensons, Jay and Emily, Chris and Patrick Troyer, Cam, Dennis, AVN and Nicole.

Walked to IKEA for dinner (plant balls and fries).
