Very loud thunderstorm last night.  
Not a very restful night's sleep.  
Woke up early again.  

## Work
Advised to follow a "process" that was only documented in an email from almost a year ago.  
I didn't handle communication around getting Annie to the doctor appropriately (used Teams instead of email).
Not a very impressive display of management.  

## Home
Drove to Leash on Life, they don't carry the cats' brands of food.  
I can't go to Ace Hardware anymore because for some reason they sell African Claw Frogs.  
Can't go to Pet Smart because they also sell live animals.  
It's hard to live trying to approach any morality.  
Compromised and stopped by Hy-Vee, where they just sell dead animals (at this one), and they were out of dry food.  

Went for a walk around the other side of the railroad tracks and saw 5 or 6 deer.  

Came back, ate dinner, watched the second episode of _Severance_ and went to bed kind of early.  
Did crossword puzzles until after 10 PM.
