Busy day at work, per usual.  
You need tight organization of data and people in order to be effective remotely.

Annie did a deep-dive on a fun research project around the [Bowery Street Grocery Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowery_Street_Grocery_Store).  
The [Johnson County Map](https://dsps.lib.uiowa.edu/mappingsegregationia/maps/) from "Mapping Segregation in Iowa" lists a race-restrictive 
covenant for the grocery store becoming active in 1941, but Annie's research has led her to suspect that this only applies to the 
"Ruppert & Mattes subdivision", not the "Lyon's 2nd Addition" that it was split from.  
Research is ongoing, and I helped a little.  

Annie had Art Office at 6 PM.  
I worked out (lifting), then made dinner (bell peppers and seitan).  
We ate and watched _Joe Pera Talks to You_ until 9 PM. It's very sweet.  

Went to bed. Texted with Baker. Played _Vampire Survivors_, then started reading 
[_What It's Like to Be a Bird_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50778832-what-it-s-like-to-be-a-bird) by David Allen Sibley.
