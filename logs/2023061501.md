* We played in our first IFPA ranked tournaments in KCMO.
* We went to the Nelson Atkins museum of art.
* Work told everyone "You don't work remotely, you do tele-work. You're not allowed to work outside of Iowa, Illinois, or your home state."
* Bought 3 pinball machines, fixed them up, placed 2 (Silverball Mania and SlugFest) on-site at The Vine in Iowa City.  
* Are negotiating a tiff with the people who do darts and jukeboxes at The Vine.  
* Placed a deposit on Foo Fighters pinball in the hopes of getting into a larger venue.  
* Working on getting Sea Witch placed.
* Are selling the trailer because of my job's policy. (Frankly were probably going to sell it anyway.)
