### Work
Work was busy, didn't take lunch, but got a lot done.  
Had a department meeting. Talked about saving money.  
Looking at our expenditures, I don't really understand how we're going to hit our savings goals if we don't touch staffing.  
Downside of being a public institution is that your numbers are available.  

### Home
After work, cooked tofu for carrot soup while doing dishes and listening to 
[_The Pinball Show_](https://www.thepinballnetwork.net/e/the-pinball-show-ep-121-part-2-from-buy-now-to-cry-now-crycrycry/) and doing dishes.  
Ate the soup, started watching [_Africa Addio_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa_Addio)[^1], 
decided to head to SpareMe to talk to Avery about the upcoming pinball tournament.

### SpareMe
Adam and Christie were there. Catnip and Kendall in the kitchen. A keg of "Margneto" had spilled in the keg fridge.  
Avery and I talked through various tournament setups (single elimination brackets, head-to-head match, group match), so he'll be able to handle 
any size of response.  
Met AVN (or Aaron) finally. I'm sure I've seen him around before, but who knows when.  
He, Avery, and I played a few tables, similar to how the tournament would go. Harry joined in too later.  
I held my own just because I was sober. The usual culprits kicked my ass. Star Wars and Guardians of The Galaxy[^2].

### Home
Headed home around 10 PM, almost went to Double Tap to check out Led Zeppelin and The Mandalorian pinball machines, 
and update [Pinball Map](https://www.pinballmap.com/), but I didn't.  
Finished _Africa Addio_, skipping around the quarter of the movie that shows hunting and poaching.  

## _Africa Addio_
I'm still processing the whole thing.  
I think of media like [_Soft White Underbelly_](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCvcd0FYi58LwyTQP9LITpA), which I refuse to watch 
and has met its fair share of criticism, but in the future, I'm sure will be praised, regardless of it's current status as "exploitation" or "propaganda".  
Like, if you watch [_Triumph des Willens_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_of_the_Will) today, you don't have to explain yourself, 
but if you watched it in 1936, it might say more about your proclivities.  
Exploitation that happened 50 years ago can be called "democratizing history", and propaganda from long ago has lost its teeth 
and is safe to consume.  
I can say for certain that it made me realize how radically differently my life is compared to many[^3] humans.  
Makes the little differences matter less (jobs, family stress, technology), and the big stuff worth keeping (running water, security, education).
