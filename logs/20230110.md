## Work
### New change management procedure just dropped.  
Additional bureaucracy.  
The problem is that we've structured our organization to "run lean" (understaffed), which doesn't allow for 
clean organizational lines, well-documented procedures, or bureaucracy. Get things done as they need to be done.  
When money was free, we would use capital to expand instead of labor (hosted solutions, consultants, etc.)  
The consequence now is that we outgrew our procedures and org chart, and trying to reorganize this year is going to cement 
some bad austerity habits, like a shadow approval process for projects because the official one is too onerous.  
Even setting an expiration date on this new process would increase adoption.  
People will put up with difficult things if there's an end in sight.

Showered at lunch. Pretty stressed about work and stuff with my family.

Also there was a 13 year-old kid shot just down the street from Annie's brother in DC at 4 AM, Saturday.  
Seems like the kid was stealing/breaking into/tampering with cars on the block, and a resident confronted him.  
The divide seems to be people outraged that someone was shot while committing a crime
and people outraged that a 13 year-old was committing such serious crimes.  
I'm just glad that we live in Iowa City. Even though a kid did try to steal a Kia from our alley back in like October.

Talked to Baker. The CEO of his firm said they're ready for him in San Francisco whenever, so it looks like he'll be moving.  
Hung out with Annie.  
Meant to study for Salesforce, but I was cooked.  
Cooked a Mafaldine Pasta meal from Purple Carrot. Very nice. Need to buy more arugala and make cheese sauces when the Co-op has sales.  
Watched an episode of _Family Guy_[^1] and the "Midlife Crustacean" episode of _Spongebob Squarepants_[^2] while Annie was at Art Office.  
We watched the semi-final episode of _The Great Pottery Throwdown_, and I signed up for the Spring pottery class from March through May.  
I was still cooked, so we watched two episodes of _Joe Pera Talks To You_, then two episodes of _Off The Air_[^3].  
Went to bed and read _The Dispossessed_. 55% of the way through it now.  
Had another fitful night's sleep and woke up tired.  

[^1]: My former hangover show, now just a comfort show, I don't like it.  
[^2]: Not available on any legal streaming service since 2018.  
[^3]: I watched this in high school. It's in the 4 AM timeslot. Very irresponsible.
