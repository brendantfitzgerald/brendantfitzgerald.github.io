## Work
Not much of interest.  
Lifted during lunch.  

## Home
Annie wasn't feeling great so we ate chips in bed.  
She showered, then we hung out some more.  
I made alfredo mac & cheese with Tuno for dinner.  
Goofed around on the internet for a bit.  
The ATF just banned shoulder-able stabilizing braces for pistols.  
Avery crushed every score Annie held on Star Wars pinball, I was 
never in the running.
