Woke up feeling better than yesterday, but still too crummy to work.  
I made breakfast for Annie and I, ripped some DVDs from Adam, measured the basement for remodeling purposes, 
and disassembled the backup Ratnest that I had in the basement to see about a Kallax-compatible computer case.  
Annie and I hung out after she was done working.  
Then she showered and we walked to the mailbox at Summit and Bowery to mail an Etsy order.  
Came home, watched [_Sunset Boulevard_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Boulevard), and ate shepherd's pie.  
We talked afterwards about communication and relationships, including my revelation that I didn't have any real-life examples of a happy relationship 
growing up, and my dream to make children memorize facts. Because you can memorize facts about a topic before you "understand" it, 
but you'll never understand a topic if you don't know the facts about it.  
We worked on a crossword until around 10 PM, then went to bed.  
My side of the electric blanket stopped working over the weekend, so between that and my illness, I'm cold every night.  
Luckily, the cats helped me.
