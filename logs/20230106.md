Worked.  
Looked at Public Space One's upcoming offerings.  
Got some exercise.  
Watched [_Total Recall_(1990)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Recall_(1990_film)).  
Annie and I talked about why the Republicans are unable to elect a Speaker of the House.[^1]   
Went to bed early and read _The Dispossessed_.

## On Creating and Sharing Creativity  

I've identified entropy and resource scarcity as my biggest excuses/justifications for not creating.  
Terrified that whatever I make won't be worth the energy that I took from the universe to do it.  

Also constantly worried about the judgment from "true" artists.  
And by that I mean people who have been consistently creative in some capacity throughout their lives.  
They've developed skills that can only be learned through practice.  

**It makes me uncomfortable to be around inequality without formality.**[^2]  
Like, in a classroom, there's structure. The teacher should be better than the student, and the goal is to help the student's development.  
Playing a (non-team) sport/game, the score tells you who's better and by how much.  

Just "hanging out" with artists is an unnavigable swamp.  
Asking questions can come off as challenging them, and it's hard to know if an idea you've pitched is actually interesting or na√Øve and being tolerated.  
This is less true of "craftspeople" who seem to enjoy my unending questions about minutiae.  

[^1]: Likely to get "primary'd" in conservative areas, or your constituents won't vote. Kind of like what happened with Democrats from 2001 to 2008.
[^2]: This thought hasn't left my head since its inception. I'm slowly teasing out to what extent this statement is applicable.
