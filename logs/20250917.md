# Morning
Weekly manager's meeting in the morning. Tons of calls in the afternoon.

# Evening
Annie ran a women's pinball tournament tonight. I meant to stay home, but had some beers on the other side of the bar instead.

I did talk to my dad for about 40 minutes. First time in a few weeks.

Came home and ate dinner while we watched an episode of Frasier.
