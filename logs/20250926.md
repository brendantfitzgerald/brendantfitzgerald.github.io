# Morning
## Reddit
Got some stuff done at work, then got distracted by the Iowa City subreddit.

I'm a moderator, and the other moderator who was brought on the same time as me has a much more *hands-on* approach than I'd like.

They locked the comments on their own post telling people to be nice *on behalf of the moderators*. Didn't clear any of it with anyone beforehand.

So I unlocked the comments and brought it up in mod chat, to my great relief, the other mods agreed with me.

It's one of the stupider sources of good feelings, but I'm glad they understand "moderator" doesn't mean "leader". It's closer to a janitor.

# Evening
Walked to Ace Hardware today because Aaron's bread pick up was moved there due to the homecoming parade. 
Convenient for us because Annie needed staples for her staple gun and I needed a dowel to try making match strikers differently at the pottery studio.

Showered, ate dinner, then exercised with Annie (backwards, I know). She was tired, so she went to bed around 8 PM.

I acquired 360p files of Seasons 1-9 of *The Simpsons* in 4:3, which is just perfect, in both quality and aspect ratio. 
I'm going to try getting them playing on my little Sony Trinitron studio monitor.
## Hear me out
I also acquired scans of the entire print run of *Playboy*. Before you say anything, I just read the articles.

Honestly though, the writing is amazing, nestled between the ads and other features, and compared to what's out there now, the other features are downright tasteful.

It got me thinking about the idea of "adult" things. Because the ads for cars and sound systems and cigarettes were targeted at adults.
They aren't saying "You'll be an adult if you buy/consume this." That's what children want.
They're saying "You're an adult. Act like it." And sometimes that means being adults wearing dorky snow outfits on an old-fashioned sled, 
and even though none of them are smoking, it's supposed to sell Newports. (The snow is cold like menthol, but still.)

So much of being an adult in 2025 is focused on recapturing youth in a variety of embarrassing and navel-gazing ways.
Process that trauma! Buy those Legos! Watch a movie about a cartoon that you watched!

And I suspect that part of it has to do with the new puritanism of the '90s. Everything had to be family-friendly, and anything not family-friendly was 
pushed to the fringes. If you're already going to get shamed for buying a nudie magazine, why not go for the gusto and buy *Hustler*? And then you 
don't have to bother with all those eggheads like Edward Abbey.

This is an extension of an idea that I had when the 23rd Vape Shop moved into downtown Iowa City. **Concentrating vice is a terrible idea.**

Moderation is a virtue, right? But the new puritan culture doesn't allow for moderation, whether that's in political opinion or sexuality or drugs.
### Vice Control
To stick to the vape shops: My pitch is adding a limit to how much of a business's revenue can come from tobacco/nicotine/off-license liquor sales.

It would do a number of things:
1. More convenient for the consumer.
2. Less pressure from businesses to push the vices because only X% of their sales can come from them.
3. Reduced incentive for eyesore vice shops.
4. Reintroduces a little bit of eyes on the street or shame. The vape shop man doesn't care if I come in every day for 2 packs of cigarettes and 
a pint of the cheapest vodka possible. A grocery store cashier who sees me buying baby formula too may react differently.

You can easily extend this vice approach to publications like *Playboy*, but I think that ship has sailed with the internet.

Probably the closest approximation would be to curate a multireddit (you can still do that), of 60% thoughtful articles, 15% softcore photography, 
and 25% ads and trying to get you to buy things.
### Comparison to Monocle and Improving Writing by Reading
I sometimes read *Monocle* magazine, and I can't tell anyone's voice from another's. I think that's on purpose because they only sign their 
articles with their initials.

Whereas at least in 1977, *Playboy* writers were very clearly different people. The writing wasn't anything profound, but a short piece 
on Galvanic Skin Response and TV ratings had more style and economy than I encounter these days.

Combine that with the "Party Jokes" section, and you've got a recipe for developing *taste* in the reader -- The idea is that the reader could 
go tell these jokes at a party. They're good jokes! They take a second, and there's variety, but by saying "Go tell this joke", you 
make the reader appreciate the joke beyond consumption. You make them evaluate it for themselves. The who/what/when/where/why.
"That's great! *But how would I say that?*", "So-and-so at X Location is gonna love this one." "Gotta save that one for the Christmas party."
(The "what" is the joke, the "why" is because laughing is fun.)

*That* is taste. 

It is now 12:30 AM again, and I am going to go to bed.
