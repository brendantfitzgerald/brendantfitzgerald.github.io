# Morning
Slowish start, but pretty good for a Monday.

Annie's feeling better and back in the office, so that's nice.

The 3 deer were back in our backyard this morning. A doe and her two fawns, although they're not fawns anymore. They're 
losing their spots as their winter coats come in. One of them had a bad looking wound on its underside, but didn't seem to be in 
pain or not eating, so I hope it's just superficial. I wish I could go down and clean it up.

Had another call in which an old project that was completed months ago suddenly needed to be changed because the business requirements 
weren't completed as they should have been.

I'm going to have to start orchestrating things beyond the IT aspect of these projects.

# Evening
Had the first official LIFT business meeting tonight from 7 to 9. Annie and I attended via Zoom because we haven't been 
feeling great.

Long story short, bad idea. They voted 33-4 to put in an offer on a property that's well above market and needs work.
The cap rates aren't there. It will probably not rent for their projected price/sqft. And now they're going to be house-poor, 
which limits what you can do with the space. Wish they'd gone with a fixer-upper house or something first to get their feet 
under them.

Moving fast is not a virtue when the whole point of the organization is guiding the development of the neighborhood.

Annie and I went to Deadwood afterwards for beer and bitching, played Ghostbusters pinball, and ate vegan macaroni and cheese for dinner.
