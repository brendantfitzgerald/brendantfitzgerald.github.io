# Morning
Slowish start, but pretty good for a Monday.

Annie's feeling better and back in the office, so that's nice.

The 3 deer were back in our backyard this morning. A doe and her two fawns, although they're not fawns anymore. They're 
losing their spots as their winter coats come in. One of them had a bad looking wound on its underside, but didn't seem to be in 
pain or not eating, so I hope it's just superficial. I wish I could go down and clean it up.

Had another call in which an old project that was completed months ago suddenly needed to be changed because the business requirements 
weren't completed as they should have been.

I'm going to have to start orchestrating things beyond the IT aspect of these projects.
