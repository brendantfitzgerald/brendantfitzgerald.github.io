# Morning
Did some digging and found that the Business Credit Card project in nCino was *not* ready. Like at all. I really need to start insisting on testing stuff myself.

Listened to the Apple Keynote Event from 2011 in the background layered with some frutiger aero ambient sounds and office sounds. It was nice. Thick bezels.
They debuted the iPhone 4S, Siri, showed the precursor to the Apple Watch (iPod Nano on a wrist strap), and a delightful app called "Cards", 
where you could print and send a postcard of a photo on your iPhone to anywhere in the US for $3, or the world for $5.

I think it's mostly nostalgia, but there was something more simple and earnest about that presentation than the big productions now.

# Evening
Went to the pottery studio. Tried my hand at making a "blate" (bowl-plate) that Annie got a hump mold for.

Came home and watched an episode of *Only Connect*, then Annie went to bed, but I stayed up too late. It's becoming a bad habit.
