# Morning
Woke up feeling bad, chalked it up to staying up too late.

Started exploratory demolition of the front porch steps, and got the posts off no problem.

The first step (literal step) was more of a problem. Couldn't access the screwheads. 
Suspect it may have even been assembled upside down and the screwheads are underneath.

So I decided it would be faster to cut through the screws with an oscillating tool. Except I couldn't find any of my blades for my oscillating tool because 
everything's out of place from the basement remodel.

So I went to Harbor Freight to buy new cheap blades (I checked Ace, but my goodness, the markup.) On the drive to Harbor Freight, I realized I 
was still feeling funny.

Came back, and just had a quick sit to feel better, which turned into three hours of dozing and eating.

# Evening
I assume I caught whatever Annie has/had. I went up to bed around 6 or 7.

She was nice enough to pick up Thai Flavors for dinner.

We ate while watching *Elvira's Haunted Hills*. I ate about half of my food, and got through about half the movie by 9.

Then I went to bed, had a fitful sleep, and read *Reamde* when I was awake throughout the night.
