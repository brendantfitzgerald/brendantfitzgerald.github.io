Annie made cinnamon rolls for Christmas breakfast.  
We tried putting vegan cream cheese on them, but it was too savory or tangy because it was cultured.  
So, I tried making a quick frosting (having never done that before): I winged sugar and corn starch into high-protein plant milk and almost burned it.  
It ended up being a decent pudding.  

I got Annie a silver(coated) mesh necklace to match her watch bands, and an official Amtrak Superliner long-sleeved shirt.  
My dad got her some faux-fur cuffs for her boots/sleeves. They're quite a statement, but she tried them out on our walk later, and they work!  
My dad got me a Lowe's gift card, and Annie's parents got me an Oxford shirt from the Vermont Flannel Company. It fits so well.  
Adam and Carla sent us Ithaca coffee. Miss them.  

We went out for a walk by the river. I think it got up to 15 degrees.  
The only place the river wasn't frozen was below the dam. So, we got to see a dozen or so bald eagles hanging out in the trees around there.  
We also saw a hawk (maybe Cooper's) circling on South Lucas.

We called our families, enjoyed a lovely dinner that Annie cooked, watched ["The Thin Man" (1934)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thin_Man_(film)), "Cunk on Christmas", and finished 2 bottles of champagne[^1]
