## Work
Not much got done today.  
A lot of hourly folks were off because they worked the conversion and there's a big stress on no-overtime.  
But also I hadn't had a full day off in like 2 weeks because of the conversion, so that's been taking its toll.  
Also, the beer from last night.  

## Home
Prepared the house for Katie & co.  
Made a point to hang out with Annie beforehand because we wouldn't get much of a chance with guests.  
Had chicken and dumplings for dinner.  
Katie, Bobby, and the kids arrived around 9. Don't know the timeline, but the kids weren't settled until maybe 10 PM, 
and the adults didn't go to bed until midnight.
